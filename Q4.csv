10685,except for the ta office hours we did not have any online class sessions,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,quite good,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,the online resources provided such as the videos and the slides were really helpful to revise the concepts after lectures and covered all the topics in class,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,the questions on piazza were not always answered there were a lot of open ended questions it would have been awesome if tas could make sure the questions on piazza were addressed,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,the online code demos were well run and instructors generally showed up to the assigned slot,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,the course website is useful and has lots of relevant links but almost too many near the start of the semester i was confused with what resources were actually helpful and which were just there for futurereference maybe the layout could be changed or a more detailed explanation could be added in addition to the preexisting discussion on the first day of class posts on piazza were generally responded toslower than in other classes,"Pavlu, Virgil"
30569,no online classes were available and the classes were not recorded,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,the tas were knowledgable but there was no online environment as such as the course was classroomonly,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,i attend to the class in person,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,lecture notes were uploaded on canvas and easy to access otherwise the course was taught in person,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,na,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,lecture slides were always posted to canvas and piazza made it easy to get timely answers to questions for the homework,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,great,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,great course,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,questions were answered at a reasonable rate through piazza,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,good class good professor he is strict at times but everything is fair the course followed closely with the required textbook so as long as you go to classes and do practice problems in the book you shoulddo well in this class the lectures were nice too although i might not recommend the 3hourlong section its a lot to process in one sitting overall i highly recommend his class,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,piazza is a good way to ask questions,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,piazza was good and helpful,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
37414,the course was quite difficult for me i had to dedicate around 50 hours each week apart from lectures for the assignment labs and codewalks i personally felt the difficulty level of the course was high,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,overall the experience was really good i found it to be very informative,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the course itself was quite intense and challenging which in turn motivated and pushed me to give my best i learned a lot through this course and would like to thank the professor for his guidance and help,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,my only criticism is that the only way to keep track of the many assignments due each week is a calendar on the syllabus page in canvas it couldve been more clear where this was some of theassignments are on canvas some on handins and handins doesnt notify you when things have been graded,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the online piazza form is very good the content is great as well,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the course is very well structured and provides a complete idea about the design patterns to structure the code that is written it covers all concepts required to be able to follow better coding practicesand helps visualize realworld scenarios to understand the use case,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the notes provided on canvas are detailed and sufficient it is easy to navigate the online course materials,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,its good,"Shesh, Amit"

37414,instructor is very smart and know stuff he cares about his student and very happy to answer his students any questions even the questions are very stupid id like to take another class ive taught if theworkload is not that insane,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,office hours and piazza were the way for online environment and it was very good and helpful,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the online course was as good as onsite course,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the online course environment provided a convenient and accessible platform for learning offering flexibility in managing coursework alongside other responsibilities the inclusion of collaborative projectswas a strong point enhancing learning through teamwork and practical application of course materials however the platform could benefit from more dynamic and interactive elements such as realtimequizzes these quizzes could serve as an engaging way to reinforce learning and assess understanding continuously additionally the discussion forums felt underutilized with minimal facilitation from theinstructor to encourage deeper dialogue among peers enhancing these aspects of the course would make the online environment more engaging and supportive promoting a more comprehensive andinteractive learning experience,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,prof shesh recorded each lecture but i attended in person he had two recorded lectures which we watched due to his travel but those were special circumstances,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,very useful tas were available online to help with any sort of question,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,loved the khoury office hours tools i was always able to interact with a ta available whenever i was stuck,"Shesh, Amit"
41152,very good,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,not very good experience for beginners in web development firstly the difficulty range of each assignment is too broad the initial quizzes are very simple but the difficulty increases progressively making ithard for beginners to keep up the recordings are only one hour each and even after watching and keeping notes there isnt simple to complete the later assignments well secondly the tas arent thoroughin grading the assignments and do not clarify the specific reasons for mistakes lastly for beginners if the assignments are not completed perfectly a lot of points are deducted yet there are no remedialmeasures typically other instructors offering this course provide extra credit but this instructor does not this is the only course in which ive received a b since coming to northeastern university,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,great course great videos,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,good,"Penarrieta, Cristian"

36915,the materials provided by prof jose are amazing and are really useful while preparing for job interviews,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,not often but effective the professor recaps the previous class very well before moving onto that days topics makes resources readily available,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,piazza question responses were helpful in troubleshooting common homework typosproblems i didnt use much oh support however i noticed a lot of students in piazza having difficulty getting in touchtas during their scheduled oh slots,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,very well structured course and professor annunziato really knows his stuff,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,love the recording makes it possible for me to review the part i got lost in the lecture,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,there was way too much handholding giving the student almost every bit of code required to finish the course leads to them not learning the ability to searchdebug i come to this conclusion due to 1 i have been a ta for studentsin other courses where students have come to expect the same and find it difficult2 i personally lose motivation to do something when everything is handed to me straight,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,there were many resources including the book provided by the professor which was very helpful in doing the assignments and understanding more about the instructions in detail,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,online canvas materials and piazza contributed greatly to my learning in this course it was also great to have the option to attend virtually especially with this being an evening class and other obligationssometimes arising the flexibility created by the online learning environment worked extremely well in this course,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,jose annunziato is a great professor and i enjoyed his classes i was not aware of the required technology before starting the classes but they helped me to gain a good understanding of web developmentbasics by the end of the class i had a solid grasp of web development and it was worth taking this course under prof jose,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,i found it extremely difficult to get help either through the class piazza or through office hours piazza questions often went unanswered for weeks and office hours required me to queue for hours to days tospeak with someone,"Annunziato, Jose"

35159,good experience,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,this course presented intriguing material but it had several organizational issues that impacted my experience negativelyconcerns the course lacked organization at times causing confusion homework assignments were frequently updated without clear announcements leading to uncertainty about completed work discrepancies between project requirements in different documents caused confusion ta availability and office hours were inconsistent often compounded by frequent cancellations or absences resulting in long wait times and disruptions heavy reliance on ta assistance made completing assignments stressful assignments sometimes used outdated instructions or code causing unnecessary challenges collaborating on the quiz project posed challenges as it built upon the homework assignments making code sharing uncomfortable i wish it had been made clear from the outset that individuals could optto work on the project alone nonetheless my team and i chose the quiz project for its clearer requirements and predefined website idea,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,the professor and the ta are both very nice and the course is wellorganized however there are errors in the assignment documents which require a lot of time to debug,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,well organized and supportive office hours,"Annunziato, Jose"

40399,it was wonderful best professor i have so far in neu,"Hoshino, Richard"
40399,very helpful,"Hoshino, Richard"
40399,a lot of materials online but we have to learn most of things by ourselves,"Hoshino, Richard"
39706,one major advantage that this professor provides over other professors is that he scanned the exam and provided it on the online platform so we could see our mistakes and improve ourselves movingforward this is a big plusthe class is excellent but the online learning experience could be improved in some ways the materials were often distributed late in the week after the assignment was announced sometimes with missinginformation that needed to be reposted later the syllabus was not updated during the semester and had incorrect dates and classes posted during holidays and such in one case an assignment was due at1159 pm on a day and the submission link was not active until around the afternoon 2 or 3 on that day this can be a bit stressful for students and it would be helpful to have these things organized andready earlier so we can plan ahead and submit before the last minute,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,good,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,the course is conducted several times on zoom and the experience is good,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,it was good he explained concepts well and was open to questions in the online part of this course,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,professor saad is very responsive and responsible in online classes just the same as he is in onsite class and office hour,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,its an onground course but professor provided us some materials online,"Saad, Nadim"

20295,good,"Veliz, Oscar"
20295, generally has been stressful and felt worse and worse each week attending the class this is a stark contrast to my other course that im taking here it feels like we are teaching ourselves everything and are expected to have foundational knowledge to help us navigate the doitourselves style of homework and if we dont have that expectedknowledge then we have an additional lesson incidentally thrown into our lap that we have to deal with if you dont find the time to teach yourself that thing now you are fundamentally behind on eachfuture assignment for students who are taking a significant financial risk in participating in this program this aspect is extremely frustrating ive had the hardest time trying to just keep up because the pace in which material is introduced in lecture with seemingly no time to properly absorb or learn the topic is incredibly fast theres seemingly no consideration for students with obligationsresponsibilities outside of class the pace of material exacerbates the stress produced from having less time to decompress between worksessionsother obligations while technically i learned a lot i strongly feel that the means to have learned what i have dont justify the ends i definitely feel like there is a higher quality of this same education to be had elsewhere andits frustrating to feel this way,"Veliz, Oscar"
17405,i attended in person most of the timecanvas contained many useful resources but sometimes they were uploaded a bit late not a big deal though,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,i felt pretty neutral about the online environment it was mostly just a support of in class,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,too many online products used why use canvas modules if the modules do not contain the assignments why have different reading materials in zybooks canvas and teams why have gradescopeassignments and canvas assignments,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17388,overall the course set up for online learning was to be expected with use of microsoft teams and recorded video lectures,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,the format of the class was good but the videos presented were often not helpful and the instructor added little value to the class,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,the online course provides a great convenience to the students the study schedule is flexible and fits our practical needs it is okay to find the team members through the teams platform however it isharder to ask for the help of tas than inperson environment,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,this was the worst 7000  i have ever spent in my life,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,the overall experience of this course does not meet my expectations for online learning environment im now enrolling other institutions online sessions and i have to say this course is not as good as otherinstitutions programs it is not worth it i can see the material from ravi is in good alignment with his homeworks but those topics are disaligned with todays instructors teach and assignments the gapbetween the learning material and assignments are causing a lot trouble among the students,"Kennedy, Justin"
20450,the videos are good,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,its good,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,good,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,none,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,perfect,"Rad, Ryan"
35075,the professor made a huge effort to connect with students and help the students connect with each other unfortunately i just dont feel the experience in teams was very impactful or organized it wasdifficult to find class materials and keep track of conversations and i did not consistently receive notifications for activity in teams,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35075,the hardest part of attending virtually is that many of the students in the class had very heavy accents and it was difficult to hear their contributions to the class prof m did his best to recap what they saidusually but i wonder if theres a way to get better mics in some of the class rooms,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35075,course materials didnt seem to correlate to the class lectures or homework in an easytounderstand way i found the online recorded lectures largely unhelpful they seem to essentially be someonereading from a textbook most of the algorithms we covered are taught in a much more understandable manner by abdul bari on youtube i gave up on the online videos about halfway through thesemester,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
31575,the assignments are worded very confusingly on the course website and pretty much only the demo explains what you need to do,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,the online course environment mainly consisted of asking questions on piazza attending office hours and watching demos all three of these were useful for learning the course materialthere were some scheduling issues such as assignments and demos being released late or not having enough slots to demo but the professor and tas were very accommodating and were flexible with theiroffice hours and moved deadlines to adapt,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
15376,this is not an online course however the professor recorded the lectures most of the time so that was useful the piazza discussions and interactions were very useful for completing the assigned coursehomeworks,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,amazing course doubts were resolved quickly and help was prompt,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,piazza helped to clear common doubts handins helped me to keep track of my grades,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,course material was comprehensive and detailed assignments were not proofread properly had issues with them,"Shesh, Amit"
40203,the professor did not teach any coding aspects in class and simply regurgitated slides from berkeley when going to office hours for help his answers were vague and did not point to any kind of resolutionthe grades took over a month to get back leaving me with no sense of where i stood in the class quizzes were assigned each week with no indication as to what would be covered rubics for assignmentswere not given until grades were given which would have been helpful for students to know exactly what was being looked at,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,more preparation materials for quizzes would have been helpful especially early on it felt hard to predict how to study to succeed on the quizzes and the concept checks did not provide much help in thisregard the slides were extremely valuable for this though so by the end of the semester i felt more comfortable with how to prepare,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,there is no communication among classmates the students came to class and leave by their own and few discussions made on piazza,"Veliz, Oscar"
17367,its flexible and i can study the course based on my schedule,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,professor jose annunziato is the best he is very friendly and makes the concepts really simple and easy to understand the course materials are really useful and the assignments are a good way to gethands on with the concepts,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,very clear explanation on concepts,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,i learned a lot from the course,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,professors and ta made the learning environment accessible to me despite the time difference,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,the professor is pretty nice and knowledgeable he is extra patient trying to help out students it would be nicer if he has some office hours for the west coast students all of his office hours are 8am whichis 5am for west coast students it is nearly impossible to get up that early to join his office hours,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,professor jose is very responsible and kind i love his class atmosphere and he is patient to answer any questions,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,the online course environment is really good,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,i learned a lot and got a lot of practice in the process of learning,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,the lecture is awesome,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,all good,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,great material,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,sometimes it was difficult to find the lecture recordings but other than that the notes objectives homework and quizzes were well organized on the canvas piazza was also really helpful as a lot of peoplehad the same questions as me,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,overall good,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,i think the time zone is really unfriendly to our west coast but the professor and ta already try them best to help us,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,good,"Annunziato, Jose"
17401,unknown  i joined in person,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,i participated in person,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,good,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,good,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,online materials being in both teams and canvas was confusing announcements were hard to follow because they were in teams,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,it was good,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,in some cases the reading got ahead of the in class content i found my skimming the reading and then coming back to it later so as not to split my focus between to many topics,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,it was perfect,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,i attended this course in person,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
13666,the course was really good and the professor was very professional and helpful,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,i think if at the beginning of the class he would give us a website for example for visually understanding many of the concepts would be great he is a very nice person but i hope he can give the code forexample for the corresponding chapterwe can run it line by line and see it more clearly will be super helpfulbut thats a lot of work,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,normal,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,this course was great for the fundamental of computer program gives a nice perspective on how algorithm works,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,it was good,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
15377,after the first couple of weeks the online experience improved with the addition of his ipad usage to facilitate the lectures,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the course work was good and increased my technical understanding with algorithms,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,not bad,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,didnt use it much,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the lectures were really great but they were way better in person where focus was easier,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,online can have more manageable time and flexibility to learn when other course might have excessive amount of work with priority selection,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the professor provides synchronous classroom links and afterclass videos to help students review and check for knowledgevery useful,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think the organization of course material was pretty straight forward but there could have been more materials for practice throughout the term and maybe just stick to canvas having two websites is abit annoying but really i think the only way to really make sense of this class is by actually going to it attendance is important and do not be afraid to hold people accountable for not showing up,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,soheil should probably upgrade his site to https otherwise good lol,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the online course environment for this particular course was not very engaging and organised whenever professor uses board for writing its very hard to follow as the cameras are not at all positioned tofocus onto the board we could barely see anything thats being taught on the board,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,his video recording online were good enough to help me review the content when needed,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,slides for the classes were uploaded on timely manner,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the online course environment was pretty limited seeing as this is an inperson class however professor behnezhad made sure the zoom stream was working for those who chose to take the course fromhome,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,soheil as a professor is really good and helpful thank you,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,classes were available online as well as offline evertime each class was recorded and the course materials were published before class making it easier to follow what was taught in the class,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,na,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,really good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,this class experience was a rollercoasterif we had not been given the anonymous feedback option on google forms and if we did not bombard you with begging pleas for 2 months to help us out the class would be failing we were struggling a lotand were lacking basic resources such as practice problems  yes there are practice problems in the book but they have no solutions how am i meant to know if i am doing them correctly professormentioned to go ask a ta but the ta doesnt have the solutions either so it takes a lot of time for them to figure it out too aka a waste of time for the midterm review we had to ask multiple times for apractice exam because we all felt really unprepared solutions were given out 2 days before the exam  he said its because he wanted us to figure it out on our own but in reality a lot of the class thinks itsbecause he didnt type up the solutions yet there was barely enough time to study because of how much time the homework takes the lack of acknowledgment was astounding and i have neverexperienced a class like this before we did not even have powerpoint slides till 1 month into the semester this class was a mess for the first 2 and a half months the semester is only 3 and half months lol irealize you are a new professor but that does not mean the students should not be heard we also begged on piazza for the midterm to be pushed a week or even to push it 1 class period so we can have anextra review he said no which makes no sense because the last week of class before the final he has been going over special topics that are not even on the final exam the reason he did not push themidterm is because he said it would mess up his schedule not accommodating to the students needs at all did not upload topics he would be teaching that week so we can prepare for class till the day ofclass we are prohibited from using outside resources specifically the internet,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,very clear consistent with the feeling of attending classes in person,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,na,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,online material was very useful for preparing for exams quizzes and solving hws,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,professor soheil put the powerpoint and recordings on canvas everyweek which is convinient for us to go over the material,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,very useful and easy to use,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,very nice and convenient,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,never take online courses,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the professor made completing this trace evaluation part of timed quiz without telling us in advance that it was part of this particular quiz and it having other questions i was given less than 30 minutesto fill out this evaluation after answering the other technical questions of the quiz i typically spend at least an hour on trace evals so please keep in mind i have more to say and would have edited for clarityif i was allowed to complete this on my own timeprofessor forbade internet use for all assignments however latex knowledge was not a prerequisite for the course therefore it is impossible to follow the rules of the course and also complete theassignments correctly and professionally it is also a highly inefficient and unnecessary restrictiononline interaction on piazza was curt ineffective and demeaning responses were very fast but almost never answered the question well were often condescending and never pointed to additionalknowledge or resources in solvingthe instructor allowed for collaboration but there was no encouragement either online or in personfew resources were pointed to by the course webpage and they were typically very late with readings posted during or immediately before the class making studying ahead of the class impossible,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the online materialshelp provided was good but could have been better,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the course materials provided and interactions on piazza was satisfactory,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,while the course page was very well organized and resources were laid out in an accessible manner the delay in response time on piazza made it difficult to receive help via the online classroom,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,it would be helpful to have the reading materials and lecture slides uploaded a day before to review before the lecture it is also helpful to continue uploading annotated lecture slides after the lecture i alsoappreciated having the zoom office hours with the professor,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,great experience the classes were very interesting,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,it wasnt really an online course but i thought the course was good for an inperson experience,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,this was a total in person class so online experience didnt really matter,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,all good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the overall experience is neutral but the professor and ta is helpful,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,it was good for the most part the one thing that concerned me and still concerns me is the fact that i have no idea what my participation is going to be i have to commute like an hour to go to the one classi have and some days i would either miss the train or i just would realize the commute wasnt worth it especially if i could just attend virtually and i dont know if that will hurt my participation grade since idont always ask questions in class,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,very fast paced for students that come from the align program but the material is good and the grading is fair,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the resources including the class recording were very organized and piazza had a good conversation,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i dont know how much you can expect to create a sense of community and connection to classmates via online lectures or discussion boards but i do think addressing the people watching online insteadof just the inperson classroom could be good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,my experience is good his lecture always include a handwritten explanation of his slide and it is also recorded and thats handy for reviewing the material after some time has passed,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,not much an online course environment,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the class material is very convenient and organized the piazza forum helps answer students questions,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the homeworks and lectures were often disorganized the response time on piazza was very slow and different tas often gave drastically different answers so it was never clear exactly what was expectedfrom us on the assignments it would have been nice to feel like the teaching staff was on the same page,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
21011,good course a lot of overlap with 5500feels like final 2030 of the course could be stretched to be the latter 50 and first 7080 condensed into the first 50,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
21011,it was well structured and materials were useful and deep to cover basic requirements i particularly appreciated how the instructor grouped what was urgent for immediate consumption and what wasoptional although as always theres no enough time to really delve deep into the learning,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
21011,very good,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
21011,a really great experience online resources each week was organized well professor christian is also patient and willing to help with solving problems,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
35058,this was definitely the best and most worthwhile online course experience of my entire graduate experience i loved having live class time rather than doing things asynchronously the online resourcesavailable for each lesson were outstanding,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,professor aloupis navigated the online environment well allowing for additional office hours and time for questions,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,professor has awesome illustrations of course contents,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,i do not think reverse style learning was very successful with preparing us for the rigor of the exams,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,didnt get to interact much with my peers but thats probably the nature of an online course,"Aloupis, Gregory"
37459,course has been mainly in person but the one online lecture was well thought out and well delivered,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,not enough material alot of the material is added during the course instead of the beginning,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,na,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,this was not an online class,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,i appreciated that the professor emphasized that his slides were to help guide the lecture and that he would sometimes reference notes he put together on his site like for the search algorithms in thebeginning of the semester,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,got to learn a lot,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,lectures could have been recorded as sometimes students are occupied with career related situations and recorded lectures would really help in such scenarios,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,professors and tas are really helpful and provide necessary help for students online,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,i would sometimes forget to look at campuswire because my other classes use piazza,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,no online experience,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
40214,good,"Sun, Zhifeng"
40214,good,"Sun, Zhifeng"
17364,overall good,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17364,the online course environment was split in a very unintuitive way with grades instructions submissions and due dates all in different locations and no easy way to keep track of what assignments are duewhen and which class topics are relevant to which problem set,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17364,i go inperson doesnt apply to me,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17600,all material online was very helpful it helped me feel prepare for class and to come in with any question,"Hamandi, Lama"

17371,online class was helpful as we could learn at our own pace,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,great,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,the professor was very shortrude in his response to student questions often just saying see section x of the syllabus for where i addressed this the same is true for questions asked during office hours they were often met by reiterating what was said in lecture rather than actually addressing the issue this made me and i assume others feel like asking questions would be met with responses that mademe feel dumb rather than by genuine support and individualized answers by the prof as a result no one has posted a single discussion post or question since the first few weeks of class there was zeroclassroom interactions  community for this course a lot of which i blame on the poor attitude of the professor  students should not feel like they are imposing when asking for help or clarity,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,good,"Aloupis, Gregory"
40215,professor was hardly available to reach online tas were very disrespectful with grading would mark off points and say our work was lucky to even be partially correct implying,"Lee, Hyonho"

40215,sdv kdsvnidsvnjpodbvop,"Lee, Hyonho"

40407,the course is onground,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
40407,i found the instructor for the web development course to be excellent the content was thorough covering everything from basic html and css to more advanced frameworks like react i learned a greatdeal and was able to apply this knowledge in my final project,"Penarrieta, Cristian"

37894,this course was very organized which helped me to prioritize both my coursework and my workwork while i didnt have many interactions with my professor i did feel as though he was always available,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,i think it is good enough nothing too fancy everything is as expected,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,good,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,expected the professors own course content rather than depending on prof ravi sundarams course so was disappointed in that aspect,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,easily one of the poorer course preparations ive ever seen the videos provided does not explain the concepts well enough always need to learn from outside sources,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,great,"Kennedy, Justin"
35265,na,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35265,the class experience was good with instructor having good discussions regarding the topic and technique taught in the session the assignments were pretty challenging and it increased my knowledgeabout the subject even though the number of assignments created a time crunch i was able to finish due to getting a proper understanding of the aspects in the class,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35265,great,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35265,na as i took this class in person,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
20301,online materials could be updated the b tree slides seem outdated,"Bhardwaj, Anurag"
20301,canvas assignments were clearly organized,"Bhardwaj, Anurag"
20301,this is an inperson class,"Bhardwaj, Anurag"
20302,the instructor provides online materials but she never offer standard solutionsfeedback for any homework,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,professor refused to provide her class notes and she refuse to provide the recordings to every class,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,ive found that the pace of the lectures can be quite rapid which sometimes makes it challenging for me to thoroughly grasp the material in realtime additionally i sometimes struggle to read thehandwritten notes on the her ipad basically after midterm i dont have much confidence about learning algorithms anymore she doesnt like to give homework answers to tas or us when i have questionsabout homework even ta cant really help i have a hard time finishing homeworks,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,the tas are very helpful,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,still one of the worst class of all time i couldve just learned everything on youtube instead of coming to class,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,she communicated online via announcements on canvas about upcoming information about the class,"Mukund, Smruthi"

21186,online experience was mostly for doubts clarifications office hours and assignment related questionsit was easy to follow and keep track of questions being asked,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,campuswire the forum for class discussions has been really helpful with the professor actively responding to all queries posted by students this has been extremely positive and comforting there are however not enough course materials resources and lecture notes the ppts that are shared serve more as a tool to provide directions to the lectures in the classroom while the professor isteaching but they do very littlenothing as a learning resource some lecture notes would be really helpful for those trying to revise,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,helpful and informative especially the papers posted for reading,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,this is mostly an inperson course and you should be prepared to attend all lectures because the professor is truly awesome,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"

20312,never created an online group to encourage discussion,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,overall experience ok,"Amjad, Tehmina"

17387,learn a lot from this course,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,the online class was very helpful,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,in our course the emphasis is often on instant responses rather than systematic learning moving from messy code to normalized code however ive found that this approach leaves a gap inunderstanding the overall architecturemoreover the challenging nature of messy code brings overwhelming workload pressure weekly i invest excessive time in dealing with messy codeim looking for a more efficient and concise approach thanks,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,good,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,supportive,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,really like this online course professor will answer students questions whenever during the online sessions,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,i like this useful course,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,very laid back course,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,this course has loads of content and it is very overwhelming once you fall behind it does get hard to catch up since sometimes this is not the only course being takenworkload should really be reduced as i struggled with that with so much information i feel like im just going through the content and fixing stuff and learning barely anything,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,its good,"Annunziato, Jose"
31750,the course was very accessible online through recorded zoom lectures slides were posted for later review,"Smith, David"

10855,this course was excellent the online materials were topical and thorough,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,professor shesh is truly exceptional in the realm of education his lectures captivate students with their engaging content and the assignments he designs are both stimulating and rewarding enrolling inthe pdp course under his guidance has proven to be an enriching experience and i wholeheartedly recommend it to others,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,this was an onground course the only online interactions we had were on piazza and office hours my overall experience was great the professor promptly responds to piazza posts especially duringdeadlines the office hours were highly productive as well based on the above two reasons i would strongly recommend this course to new graduate students,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,while the online interactions werent a lot as the classes were held offline professor shesh would reply to all the important and necessary questions with enough information to go on the right track i likedthis part as instead of directly giving out the answers the professor would reply in a way which made us think if we were going on the right track or not,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,it was good,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,the online course environment provided a flexible and accessible platform for learning the use of digital resources recorded lectures and online materials allowed me to engage with the course content atmy own pace the communication tools such as discussion forums and email facilitated effective interaction with the instructor and fellow students while the online format presented its unique challengesthe wellstructured course design and clear instructions made navigation straightforward overall the online course environment proved to be a valuable and efficient way to pursue academic goals,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,the professor was very much active on piazza and it really helped a lot during the assignments especially because of the really long waiting lines in office hours,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,the online experience was good except that sometimes it was difficult to connect with a ta during office hours the ta would be busy with a single student for a very long time and sometimes the queuetime would be 34 hoursthe piazza queries were usually answered promptly by the tas and the professor,"Shesh, Amit"
11550,one of the best online courses taught,"Annunziato, Jose"

11550,professor was interactive in lectures however office hours with instructors was difficult queues were long and no reason was given to interact with classmates,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,very good experience the only issue was the tas were non responsive and the worst of any course i have taken so far,"Annunziato, Jose"

11550,great professor greating teaching,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,i still enjoy taking online classes because i can watch the professors videos over and over again until i get it and for me online classes are a little more efficient than offline ones but its a challenge for selfdrive,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,this is by far my favorite course i absolutely loved the way it was taught,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,its good though the interaction can be little less professor managed to keep the documentation so detail that we barely need any assistance,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,online course environment had sufficient resources to help me with my course,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,taking online course is great but did not get chance to interact much with my fellow students,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,the assignments were well done overall and had good instructions,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,the class was very interactive and collaborative even in an online format the professor attended to all the queries posted during the class,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,good,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,i felt like the class would have been better online the online class shouldnt even have been offered deadlines were pushed back final project is nearly impossible to do with all the deadlines pushed backhowever the deadlines had to be pushed back because of the poorly written documentation which might have been out of date i would have loved professor annunziatos class offline there are too manylectures to catch up on but scheduling would have been better if offline i enjoyed how much help hed give in oh but i feel like it was also giving him and the tas more workload if the docs assignmentscourses were not so disorganized his tas would also often not attend oh,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,the online experience was great prof jose is extremely accommodating and creates a good classroom environment even on a zoom call,"Annunziato, Jose"

37421,it was enriching,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,i found the overall design and structure of the course to be very clear and effective however students from other departments might struggle a bit after the initial foundational sections are covereddespite this the course is overall very helpful and informative,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,the office hours were not so helpful piazza is decent,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,prof mitra posts the ppt we discuss in class on canvas,"Mitra, Joydeep"

35156,the instructor tas and students are very active in discussing and answering questions,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,na,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,the professor would go to a conference and we would have recorded lectures which is almost impossible to foster a sense of community and interactivity,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,good,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,the course is designed really well but at the same tine it contains too much it is difficult for a student whos studying ai for the first time to keep up with the speed of teaching this made course littleoverwhelming,"Amato, Christopher"

11209,class was in person,"Amato, Christopher"
11209,great course,"Amato, Christopher"
40251,the professor made a huge effort to connect with students and help the students connect with each other unfortunately i just dont feel the experience in teams was very impactful or organized it wasdifficult to find class materials and keep track of conversations and i did not consistently receive notifications for activity in teams,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
40251,the hardest part of attending virtually is that many of the students in the class had very heavy accents and it was difficult to hear their contributions to the class prof m did his best to recap what they saidusually but i wonder if theres a way to get better mics in some of the class rooms,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
40251,course materials didnt seem to correlate to the class lectures or homework in an easytounderstand way i found the online recorded lectures largely unhelpful they seem to essentially be someonereading from a textbook most of the algorithms we covered are taught in a much more understandable manner by abdul bari on youtube i gave up on the online videos about halfway through thesemester,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
11744,the classrooms were well equipped with technology to enable proper online environment for students who take the class remotely,"Smith, David"
11744,piazza was a good choice as other students could expose his logistical wrongdoings,"Smith, David"
