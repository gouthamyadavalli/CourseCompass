                "prof raj is a handson person he gives his best to bring a holistic experience while presenting the topic he would provide reading papers and coding assignments to keep students covered across thebreadths and depths of the subject",
                "the strengths of this course is that there was room to explore and challenge oneself although not by raising the base requirement i feel this aspect made the course rewarding and fruitful for all studentsthe strengths of the instructor was his down to earth nature and how approachable he was his depth of knowledge and emphasis on this depth really ensured that all students had a solid grasp on allconcepts",
                "covering the wide range of domains under artificial intelligence and giving assignments that helped us understand and implement these was a great source of learning",
                " the instructor approaches the topics with a gusto that reflects passion he has amazingly curated presentations and slides he includes a multitude of handson examples which makes his classes even more interesting his assignments have written and coding submissions which furthermore cement the foundations the instructor by himself is extremely congenial and approachable",
                "very knowledgeable and interactive and supportive",
                "the class was really inclusive and interactive",
                "prof venkat has a youthful energy when he teaches he has his ideas and concepts clear in his head and makes the lectures interactive no doubt as he gains more years of experience im sure he willbecome one of the best ai professors at northeastern",
                "the class was always fun with good presentation and demos",
                "the professor was very enthusiastic about the class",
                "1 very active and responsive instructor responds to queries on campuswire really quickly also provides solutions to all technical problems that may arise during assignments2 very friendly and open to discussions3 prof has lot of demos which are great for some topics4 assignments are very light and manageable",
                "he really loves his students to bits i would message him at 3 am and he would be there to help ive never felt like i was alone in this course and it was truly one of the best interactive experiences ive had atnortheastern he teaches just enough to engage the students attention  makes them want to learn  and then it is up to the student to put in the effort to cover the content",
                "i think the instructors affinity for ai shows and makes it more engaging",

                "this was his first time teaching in northeastern and perhaps a proper graduate classroom and he did a good job the assignments were similar to what he taught in class but anyone interested in learning aiand has a decent programming background can navigate through the assignments and classes fairly easily",
                "the professor had very good understanding of the topics he was teaching and he taught them in a way that made them easier to understand",
                "the instructor is really good and try to teach students useful knowledge",
                "1 teaching style was something i enjoyed it was more catered to our will to learn2 always on time and ensured that the classes were not boring with a lot of demonstrations3 ensured that we explored new possibilities and made sure that we learnt the concepts to solve the assignments",
                "the assignments set by the professor were based on the topics taught in the class this made the course more enjoyable as i would understand the concepts and apply them in the assignments professorwould take time to answer the questions asked and if he did not have the answer he would give the answer and explanation in the following class",
                "it was a big class with over 100 students sometimes its hard to follow when professor speaks without a microphone on",
                "he has great presentation skills and also he is very knowledgeable",
                "the lecture content would give a great overview of the concepts and build foundation for selfpaced learning outside of class",
                "converses with students like a peer and helps clarify any doubts andor help with homework readily",

                "i believe the material could have been more structured but given that the faculty was new and that this was his first time taking this course i believe he went above and beyond what i would expect a newprofessor would be able to do",
                " more informative slides and notes i personally like video simulations and the working behind algorithms and models  would appreciate more of them as they make the class extremely intuitive",
                "sometimes the professor goes a little fast especially when it is related to math concepts but he takes all questions and answers them however could pace down a little sometimes",
                "make the content and the lectures bit more detailed and organized",
                "discuss the papers he included under reading for the next lecture in class have more handson coding sessions in class and increase the character limit to more than 140 in his quizzes",
                "more tas for better doubt clearing when in need",
                "in the early part of the semester you can follow the powerpoint and learn a lot but later on its not so easy to follow",
                "1 there needs to be a lot more study material readings and notes ppts are not nearly enough they cannot serve as a resource for self study they merely delineate the topics covered in the lecture2 the teaching assisstants seem to change their office hours timings every other day3 have an unofficial prerequisite of basic probability and linear algebra maybe take the first two classes to share to the point high quality resources for these topics and keep a graded assignment to testthese topics since without these it is impossible to grasp anything from mdps and machine learning",
                "i feel like more informative slides would definitely help more but the professor also didnt have much time to prepare for this course and is definitely an iterative process that will only get better and better",
                "explain the concepts in more detail and make the teaching more engaging",
                "i found myself taking in a lot of technical information like formulas or howtos like how to get loss or something at once and often leaving class forgetting most of it im not sure if this is the fault of theinstructor or me probably mefirstly i think for parts where you writedraw instead of having slides having uploaded notes would be great to look back oversecondly why i think the fault is on me is because im not an ai student and i took this class to try it and i found that i dont really like it so it was easy for me to lose interest in class when so much wasthrown at me which lead to the aforementioned issueregardless though class was enjoyable",
                "typed up notes to review after lecture",
                "i know this was the first year teaching but i would have loved to have more resources and examples on current topics as well as supportive topics that are prerequesets as reminders to bring those behindup to speed",
                "provide more informationbackgroundexplanations in the slides for better review of concepts",

                "have more readings from texxtbooks for the class as just the notes and slides were not enough sometimes",
                "i really think the set of quiz is so unreasonable if you answer wrong one question you can only get 80 marks it may be reasonable to set 5 questions for a 5 points quiz now you can only get a100otherwise b80 which i think is not fairthe homework tries to include too many things sometimes the pdf is not same as the code description and needs to use campuswire to correct them the details are sometimes not so clear related tohomework i have to revise my homework several times according to the update in campuswire",
                "i hope the toughness of assignment 2 was a bit less",
                "maybe the lectures could be recorded so they can be revisited laterbetter in class resources could be used as the board was not visible properly in the class and sometimes it was difficult to hear him if the mic was not workingtas should be better prepared to answer questions related to the assignment as i found many times they werent able to clear doubts easily",
                "improve the expectations of the assignment sometimes i wasnt able to understand what was being asked of me until i spoke to the professor",
                "for me personally i felt that during assignment 3 which required heavy usage of pytorch as i had not used the library before and was not aligned with the terminologies it would have been very helpful ifprofessor had taken extra classes or shared some exercises so that i could have tackled the assignment better it does not make sense to teach the fundamentals in the regular class but since i never gotthe opportunity to use these libraries in my undergraduate program or while i was working doing this would have been helpful for me",
                "1 using a microphone if its a big class",
                "he couldve written some code during the class to demonstrate the concepts",
                "the instructor uses a color scheme for the slides that is friendly for color blindness issues however we had plenty of lectures where slides were projected on the chalk board instead of the projectorscreen since the colors of the chalk board and the projector screen is totally opposite the color blind friendly color scheme was not as viewer friendly in terms of readability against the dark backgroundchalkboard",
                "incredible instructor and course no changes",
                " added some more content into the slides atleast for later reference sometimes its hard to just look at the material provided for that class to recollect what was discussed during the class the notesprovided is not helpful enough",
                "take a few months off prepare the course material and then start teaching again",
                "the highlevel discussions on nlp and computer vision were interesting but i could not really follow the technical aspects and didnt feel like i have learnt much",
                "i think a recording would really help students reviewing the course material i understand that his lecture slides are supposed to be vague to make it easier to readsee but it does not help a lot when itcomes to reviewing using it homework can be phrased a bit clearer with what direction he wants it to be and there should be some scale that student can use to determine how correct they are with theirsolution without having to involve the ta or the professor and so far that is only available for assignment 1 the last homework can use a bit of an extension too since the final project is around the corner bythat point and its hard to juggle both at the same time"
