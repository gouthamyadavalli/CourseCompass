                "i cannot say enough good things about prof aloupis the way he breaks down difficult concepts is fantastic his library of online resources filled with his previous lectures and slides is infinitely helpful  ivewatched each lecture multiple times and i think i will continue to reference them throughout my careerhe explains algorithms in a very visual way in the past ive struggled with grasping some of the harder concepts because the way theyve been explained in books or class has been really flat  i haventbeen able to really see how some solutions or even data structures work but prof aloupis takes the time to make them really accessible his diagrams are brilliant he color codes everything which makesthings so much clearer  i can actually see how things fit together he doesnt speed through steps he concentrates on the theory and the concepts and really explains the why and how behind everythingwhich means we actually learn and understand the concepts and can use them later rather than just memorizing them he goes over actual problems so we can see how theories work in multiple situationsprof aloupis is approachable and asks questions of students during class to encourage participation its clear there is no judgment and there are no dumb questionsi really appreciated him taking the time to survey students early in the semester and then reach out to us to have oneonones its so hard to create a sense of community in online classes and this was agreat way to make connectionsi very much appreciate that he offers makeup lectures whenever theres canceled class due to holidays i feel this class has excellent valueits obvious that prof aloupis values student input and is constantly striving to improve",
