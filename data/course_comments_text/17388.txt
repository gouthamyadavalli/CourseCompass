                "the format of the course with videos and short quizzes and then hw that allowed us to apply that weeks material to problems was helpful the numerous tas with varying hours was helpful",

                "this was the worst course i have ever taken at northeastern as i said in the strength professor kennedy is a nice person but doesnt teach anythingthe videos are from another professor and are only 10 minutes each for very advanced topics professor kennedy doesnt grade the tas did i dont understand why he was paid for this course he held aweekly lecture that was usually an hour long where he simply went over the same slides as the module videos no additional context they were a waste and most people stopped watching themthe worst part was when you ask the professor a question about a homework assignment he wouldnt answer he wanted you to provide justification when turning in your homework as to what youassumed the problem may have been asking this guy is the worst professor at this schoolavoid at all costs you will spend 99 of your time on youtube or taking a coursera course to actually learn",
                "the instructor could work on value add with his teams comments and the intro video he made each week for the video he often seemed to go over the slides directly which is what the course videos do sothey were not helpful",
                "more space for project and deleting the homework for last two modules",
                "it was hard to find the tas office hour schedule and there was no feedback on which parts of the assignment solutions were wrong it would be better to provide a dropin office hour schedule of tas andmore feedback when grading assignments",
                "make it more lively or communicative sessions live classes",
                "the best way to make this course better for the instructor is leave this position immidiately this instructor is not good at helping students with close followups and not able to handle large group ofstudents there are nearly no interactions or office hours and students has great difficuties finding him for questions what makes things worse he does not follow his own rules on grading my suggestion ishe could be perform better on small groups on special topics but not courses like this we all can feel this course is killing him and us",
                "the course videos are quite rushed with some examples not really getting the depth they probably need for instruction external content was needed",
                "change the due time for first two assignments and quizes",
                "my experience in this course was challenging due to the complexity of the subject compounded by the limitations of an online format while navigating this course i sought guidance and clarification onseveral occasions hoping to solidify my understanding my attempts to confirm my comprehension of the material were denied responses from one of the tas which left me feeling confused anddisappointedfurthermore the responses provided to students seeking clarification on homework questions or topics often boiled down to a nonresponse read the instructions this approach felt insufficient anddiscouragingencouraging a more interactive and supportive environment during office hours and in responses to questions would benefit students striving to grasp this challenging subject matter i hope that futureiterations of this course consider these aspects to provide a more enriching learning experience",
