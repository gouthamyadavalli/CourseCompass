                "please update the syllabus to state the expected hours students need to dedicate to this class i spent on average 30 hours per week for the this class it would helpful to advise students the expectation forthis class is well above the mandatory 1016 hours graduate classesthe textbook introduction to algorithms by thomas cormen charles leiserson ronald rivest and clifford stein was fantastic the other textbook algorithm design by jon kleinberg and eva taros was notuseful in parallel most of the northeastern module videos were not useful and unpractical a suggestion would be to update those module videos for this class",
                "improve assignments and quizzes the topic in the problem set is always ahead of what we learned in the class as a result students struggle to catch up on assignments dont release all quizzes at the end ofthe semester grade assignments on time not after weeks reply to students messages and dont ignore them publish assignment grading rubrics thats why students know how to write answers toassignment questions"
