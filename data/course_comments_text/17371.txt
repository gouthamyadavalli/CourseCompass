                "the professor created optional homework assignments but then graded them much harsher than the tests were graded i got points off for both being too explicit in my proofs and not being explicit enough it felt like he instructed his graders to assess whether we answered the homework in the same way he did proofs in class rather than assess how we we answered the question itself i have always beentaught that there is no one right way to prove something  proofs are a form of communication like essay writing and should be assessed based on how well the point is communicated since homework wasso poorly graded and did not contribute to my actual grade i stopped doing them altogether half way through the course",
                "good and easy to follow material",
                "course taught valuable problem solving skills in addition to the obvious teaching of algorithmic approaches and optimizations also this is more a personal opinion than a general strength of the course but ithought the course was very interestinginstructor explained subject matter clearly provided thorough answers to questions both in office hours and via email responded promptly to emails fostered student enthusiasm for the course material",
