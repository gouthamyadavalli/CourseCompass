                "good at explaining hard concepts in a simple manner good at breakdown hard to read textbook chapters into easy to follow lectures",
                "i really enjoy how the professor would sometimes leave small  managablysized holes in the material in class leaving bits for us to think about on our own time with this i knew where to devote my extratime to go deeper into the content",
                "the instructor was very clear about the expectations for the course and cared about the learning of the students very much",
                "professor pavlu is highly knowledgable great teaching style and expresses ideas very effectively related how certain topics have modern day applications immense knowledge and overall an excellentprofessor the exams were highly challenging and pushed us to prepare harder for it",
                "the way professor pavvluu teaches algorithms once the class is done even the advanced topics start to seem easy and he does this without spoon feeding everything making you think about all the detailsand coming up with spolutions on your own",
                "professor was very knowledgeable about the material",
                "he is very enthusiastic about this course even after teaching it for so many years he explained everything clearly but also challenged everyone to think for themselves as well he cleared all doubts foreveryoneif you want to learn about algorithms and then potentially work in top tech companies i strongly recommend taking his class as it will help you understand where you stand",
                "the instructor was great at teaching and explaining the difficult concepts of the course he used visualized and outlines very clearly and well in class on the whiteboard while explaining the concepts classwas definitely valuable and every word out of his mouth was pure gold",
                "profvirgil is a great instructor the best in neu an oldfashioned teaching style of writing everything on the board instead of slides makes the course interactive and engaging",
                "i think that the professor is very passionate about algorithms"

                "provide some kind of pre requisite brush up materials the initial days were full of math and i really struggled to find the rhythm i completed by bachelors 6 years ago and the last time i studied math was 7years ago so was finding it a little hard to follow along the math was nothing new just that i was out of touch for a long period and the class was fast paced",
                "do some more background concepts coverage for people who are not having the sufficient prereq else the course becomes too heavy",
                "sometimes i feels like the professor wants to make the course hard simply for the sake of making the course hard not to challenge the students directly in addition i wish we had more time in the classdevoted to solving problems rather than just lecture however i do understand that we were very short on time and taking time out of lecture to do this might not be possible",
                " since this is the undergraduate section of graduate algorithms do not just brush over concepts that we shouldve learned in undergraduate when this is the section specifically meant for people whohavent taken it before make the homework and midterms more relevant to what we actually go over in class i understand graduate courses are more independent but it should not be to the extent where i can only do 1 of thehomeworkquestions based on what i learned in class and the rest i have to teach myself or teach the material that will be on the homeworkmidterm in class return homework grades and regrades back in a timely manner it is impossible to assess how well we understand the material if we dont know our grade more often than not students piazza questions are unanswered and it is very difficult to get help and feedback the midterm is incredibly unproductive and does not evaluate how well we know the material in the class just how well we knew one specific topic that we had yet to receive sufficient feedback on lessthan 10 of the class got above a 50 and even with a curve the average was still failing  8 hours is too long for an exam with 6 questions that doesnt even assess most of what we have learned",
