# Extract data from a structured pdf file

# Each pdf file contains a table with the following sections:
#   Initially it has information about the course, such as the course code, title, and description.

#  Then it has a table with the following sections:
#  It has responses from multiple students to some questions about the course.
#  each question starts with Q: followed by the question and then the responses from the students.
# The responses are indexed by number, followed by the response text.

# The goal is to extract the responses from the students and store them in a structured format.
# The structured format is a dictionary with the following keys:
#   course_code
#   course_title
#   course_description
#   responses

# The responses key will have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has the following keys:
#   question
#   responses
# The responses key will have a list of responses from the students.

# The function extract_data_from_pdf takes a file path as input and returns the structured data.
# The function should read the pdf file and extract the data as described above.

# You can use the PyMuPDF library to read the pdf file.
# You can install the library using the following command:
# pip install pymupdf
