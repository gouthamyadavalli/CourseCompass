10685,i think a lot of students are not initially confident about their solutions and methods and reasoning so including a bank of solved question i feel would be one of the greatest resources for average students ifnot allotherwise there is no way his lectureclass could be more inclusive each lecture was a concentrated dose of pure insight,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,i strongly believe he is one of the best professor in khoury,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,at the beginning of the course and throughout each new concept the instructor would oftentimes use words designed to scare the students about the difficulty of the material in the course this turned meoff to some of the earlier lectures due to the fear tactic that he employed which was probably just to get people serious about the course and its difficulty however the students already knew the extent ofthe difficulty of the class and this only turned scared me enough to turn me off to learning,"Pavlu, Virgil"
30569,the professor used to be quite abstract at times about the concepts he was trying to explain this is subjective but having more visualizations would have really helped me score better there is a lot of selflearning involved which is good but also infeasible at times due to time constrains in general,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,i think my instructor is good enough,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,sometimes his penmanship is hard to read,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,strength explanation of complex problem statements very wellimprovements could go little slow,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,all good,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,great course,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,he will ask us questions if we dont have any questions the questions guide us to think on different aspect of the algorithm,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
37414,i liked the professors dedication to delivering highquality lecture the professor demonstrated clear passion for the subjecti am grateful for the opportunity to learn from such a knowledgeable instructor,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,none,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,overall it is a very inclusive class there was just one thing when classes first started the professor said that we are not allowed to join the teams live lecture its just for recording purposes if we doeveryone in person can see who is not attending class it felt kind of intimidating if we were actually sick or needed to attend remotely then we would be judged,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,he knows how to throughly explain concepts,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the instructor is very knowledgeable and explains the concepts in a detailed manner he is very supportive and provides a good feedback on any doubts or queries asked his office hours are very useful andalso encourages students to push their boundaries to think of better coding approaches,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,overall the professor was great his teaching style was amazing and was very helpful in office hours as well i do not have any particular areas of improvement to suggest,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,hes good no comment,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,as mentioned one of the best professors ever met in terms of teachingexplains all the issues and solutions in detailcan hardly see any points that needs to be improved,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the professor teaches the course very well so nothing much to improve,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the professor was always available for outoftheclass discussions and doubtsthe professor gave constructive feedback on the exam solutions and different ways to solve a problem,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,every wednesday there will be a homework due however instructor always make an requirement change on tuesday class then everyone have to change their current progress even they have alreadydone,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,he is very good just 1 suggestion  he should explain how to write test cases please,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,he can make student understand knowledge easier by his speech,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,while i appreciate the structure and content of this course i believe there is significant room for improvement in terms of embracing evolving educational standards and methodologies as industries andtechnologies develop it is crucial for academic curricula to reflect these changes to remain relevant and effectivei observed that the course predominantly reflects a singular perspective primarily influenced by the instructors specific viewpoint in a dynamic learning environment incorporating multiple perspectivesand adapting to contemporary practices are essential for fostering a more robust understanding of the subjecti would recommend updating the curriculum to include a broader range of ideologies and teaching methods this update could better prepare students for practical application in their future careers byaligning more closely with the latest industry standards and practices,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the group projects were the most fun ive ever had in a cs coursein terms of inclusive learning i wouldnt change a thing,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,sometimes the requirements are not clear for assignments which could be improved on,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,professor shesh is great at providing feedback in lecture and online through piazza or teams,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,professor shesh is a great instructor he makes his lectures accessible engaging and proivdes opportunities to put them in practice with his homework there are still struggles in managing the teamworkcomponents of his assignments as well as making sure his assignment materials are up to date,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,na,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,provide more transparent fair and reasonable scoring system,"Shesh, Amit"

36915,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,the professor possesses strong communication skills and is consistently available to assist students his grasp of web development is thorough ensuring that he imparts knowledge effectively theassignments are meticulously structured facilitating not only learning but also the practical application of concepts in project development this thoughtful design of coursework allows students toprogressively build their skills and confidence in web development,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,as i said the three hours of live coding dont facilitate inclusive learning also the instructor team should pay more attention to assignment preparation this professor has taught this class for manysemesters so errorfree and clear assignment instructions are the basic expectation there are six assignments this semester and every assignment has more than five errorstypos which is unacceptableand makes people feel the instructor didnt treat the class seriously,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,if the code on the homework actually works it makes learning the content easier instead of spending a lot of time debugging,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,the professor values an inclass learning environment that benefits everyone by ensuring the classroom is quiet allowing all students to fully focus on the lecture rather than discussing the course materialduring class,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,he is clear and passioante about his teachings,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,the class definitely imo focuses on breadth over depth i understand why it is a priority to have students touch on all the important concepts however it felt like a constant race to catch up witheverything i never really felt like i had a solid understanding of any given topic and rather than having time to work through it had to forego that understanding to be able to keep up with the next topic,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,he usually explains some difficult and complex content in simple way that we can all understand,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,see above,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,while the instructor was helpful and approachable he could improve inclusivity by being more available outside of class and diversifying communication channels,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,i hope we can spend an additional one or two classes on how to use javascript as im having a hard time digesting the new technology,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,the highlight is the way this course is organized the instructor has made efforts to design the course to help us learn the tech stack required by the companies for the present day it was a great course oneof the best i have taken at neu,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,its about ta part i have met these things too many times ta cancel the office hour frequently they showed late and reschedule the office hour i know it maybe emergencies but it is too frequent foronline courses the essential part is office hours but it didnt work as i expect,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,smaller class more communication and feedback rather than just providing a word document for assignment requirements less nitpicky assignment requirements smaller knowledge gaps betweenassignments,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,please hire better and responsible tas the current tas are really bad and the professor given the amount of hard work he puts in deserves better tas,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,coursework was great,"Annunziato, Jose"
21104,very inclusive in all aspects probably the professor that cares about inclusivity the most so far i have seen,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,he is very friendly but i kind of hope the assignments are not so infrequent but big we pretty much just have 4 massive projects and almost nothing else i hope we had more lightweight projects and lessheavy massive projects instead,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,everything is good,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,loved the attitude i liked coming to class,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"

21104,na,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,professor john is very supportive some improvements could be that some rubrics may not be very clear to understand when we have the project teamwork does not achieve the goal of learningsomething withing a partner,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,while class was helpful sometimes it felt like the projects had nothing to do with what we had covered so far connecting to mongo and implementing crud was taught after that project was due same withteaching passportexpecting implementation having a more conducive schedule would be helpful to helping with our understanding rather than expecting us to figure it out completely on our own iunderstand that struggling is helpful with teaching but i dont think its fair to expect students to learn how to implement for assignments when the topics were not even properly introduced yet,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,sometimes the class can be quite stressful for introverted individuals like myself,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"

39710,i like how the prof creates a environment of learning i still remember in the first lecture maam brought cards to teach us insertion sort being able to picture what was happening made it very easy for meto understand it i really enjoyed studying this course and would love to take more course under prof lama,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,professor is very nice and knowledgeable if we could focus more on leetcode questions and let us discuss  solve those questions with what we learned that will be more helpful,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,na,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,include more content in lecture thats not in reading,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,the weekly course plan is well designed,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,good,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,great,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,na,"Hamandi, Lama"
40399,this class will be very difficult but only compared to other water classes but precisely because of the difficulty the teacher will give a lot of help the only thing you need to do is to keep up with the teacherand seize the time for everything because you will find that this can be a very shining moment in your lifei would give richard a thumbs up,"Hoshino, Richard"
40399,na,"Hoshino, Richard"
40399,cant think of any,"Hoshino, Richard"
40399,richard is knowledgeable passionate and approachable had all the great traits to help us succeed,"Hoshino, Richard"
39706,this professor is irreproachable in this area he is sure to move at a pace that all can follow and does his best to allow all students to participate he also allows for ample question time,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,it would be helpful if the instructor could slow down the pace when explaining the new concepts and use less handwriting on the whiteboard,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,overall he is a friendly and good professor he provides good examples on the whiteboard and is open to student questions if he could provide information in advance that would be helpful,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,na,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,he did a great job already,"Saad, Nadim"

20294,sometimes the class can be quite stressful for introverted individuals like myself,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20295,the passion for experiential learning is great but this is not experiential learning experiential learning needs more flexibility to adapt to the needs of the students this was instead more of a learn on yourown but with an impossible deadline there wasnt the time available to learn before we moved on to the next topic,"Veliz, Oscar"
17405,everything said above,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,i really enjoyed having dr mwaura as a proffessor,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,nothing more to add than what i have already said,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,na,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,1 i suggest clearer segregation of assignments on canvas particularly for students without zybooks access to avoid confusion2 more transparent grading criteria on gradescope would help students understand the rationale behind deducted points,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17388,this is the first time i felt a course is a waste of my time and money i learned almost nothing from this professor or this course the professors interaction with students is minimal impacting the learningexperience and he makes everything very difficult for students ta office hour is not clear on teams regrading need to send a report that even takes more time than the homework itself the syllabusdoesnt match the course material too much to list please check all his wired setting for the class the course materials particularly the videos and slides are bad they primarily consist of reading offslides which is not effective for deep learning especially in an algorithm class where critical thinking and detailed explanations are crucial i am very disappointed,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,online engagement through teams was decent,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,1 make your own module videos2 provide actual feedback to students and answer their questions,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,there is a lot of opportunity for the live professor to add value to the course,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,the instructor did a good job on wellorganized teaching materials it would be better if more details about the application examples are given,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,na,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,i guess professor kennedys strength could show up once he found relaxed with small group of people without dumb questions there is no chances for him creating an inclusive learning at this scale he isnot capable of this but on small groups maybe there could be a chance,"Kennedy, Justin"
20450,the lecture is very clear,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,good,"Rad, Ryan"
35075,a true teacher,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35075,the learning was inclusive prof did a great job including the students who phoned in each week this material is just hard,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35075,give more practical questions like solving questions and then uploading source code for assignments there are only 10 of questions are leet code practical questions others are theory questions givefeedback for a final project proposal i never received feedback for my final project proposal even though i requested to review my project but the professor ignored my messages,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35075,more focus on dynamic programming in class,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
31575,how is this class in the ai concentration for cs we did one ai homework and it wasnt even remotely challenging,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,the instructor is very kind was fairly flexible with deadlines and clearly cares about student success and wellbeing,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
15376,prof sheshs ability to teach is his biggest skill which makes him an effective instructor the only area of improvement like mentioned earlier is more availability to his students i know he is the dean of cswhich could make this more challenging,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,get better tas who are able to grade more consistently,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,prof shesh knows how to capture students attention and is very eloquent i am impressed and admire his way of teaching his comments and answers are very interesting and can be interpreteddifferently depending on the student,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,the instructor is knowledgeable and has the teaching skills required however it could have been better if the instructor could actually cover the content required for the assignment before the deadline ofthe assignment,"Shesh, Amit"
40203,quizzes are given every week without any guidance on what they will be on not everyone learns well in this manner i for one struggle with quizzes as someone with attention issues it is hard for me to retaininformation unless i study specific points without knowing what to study i am at a huge disadvantage in this class,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,quizzes dont need to be there for every class some classes dont cover a lot and quizzes are then on concepts either too trivial or not too much of,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,no additional comments,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,i personally does not like the chess assignment overall as an introduction to ai class the chess assignment does not seem to be intro level overall the beat random bot requirement needs lots of learningoutside class and does not seem to be related to the class topics i feel there is a gap between lectures and assignments,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,professor oscar is very accommodating in facilitating inclusive learning,"Veliz, Oscar"
17367,the tas are not very responsible especially about their office hours they regularly dont show up on their office hours with or without prior notice furthermore there are too many office hours cancellationeven with the prior notification which frustrates students who need help for the class also some tas just easily say they dont know about the problem and ask us to ask other tas which is not veryprofessional as ta they must be more responsible and help their students especially when they encounter some problems they dont know they need to contact professor and get some solutions andcontact the student back not just saying they dont know other than some unprofessional tas this course was very well organized and helpful to learn web development,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,make the homework more reasonable so we dont need to waste time on doing repeat work,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,what in tarnation is inclusive learning,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,i greatly appreciated the detailed instructions for both labs and homework probably to make it more inclusive i would personally decreasecut the number of homework requirements,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,a lot of tas dont show up on their working hours at all it should be regulated that if they dont come please send out a message beforehand on canvas stop wasting lots of students time by ghosting in theoffice hours,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,strengthen the training of teaching assistants the points they give are unreasonable,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,recommend some better projects for us to study,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,all good,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,great teaching,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,the professor always listens to and incorporates our feedback into his teaching which is helpful this includes posting his code onto github so we can use it as a template and simplifying assignments to taketime to comprehend concepts also the class is structured in a way that you understand how the topics build off of each other and flow together,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,i hope professor could give more guidance for deploy issue,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,none,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,good,"Annunziato, Jose"
17401, all positive for professor mwaura on inclusive learning,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,professor mwaura really strives to include everyone id say its just an overall strength of his on the other hand sometimes wed stall class for a little to go over a topic if some folks didnt get it it would benice if some of that work could happen outside of class,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,good,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,was really good with this,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,he is an enthusiastic instructor but sometimes he can stretch out a specific topic for too many classes,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,the class itself was very enjoyable despite the difficulty of the material this is all thanks to dr mwaura,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,i imagine its easier to get a good grade in this class than in other professors because its all openbook and basically untimed and the grade is more based on putting in the time than actually mastering thematerial but if you want to really learn from your professor instead of learning from books on the side dont take this class,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,the professor always came very prepared for class sessions its very easy to feel the energy and passion he has and how much work he puts into preparing for lectures he knows how to slowdown whenstudents have hiccups with certain concepts and is always ready to give more elaborate explanations he is also readily available to chat after classes and during office hours about concerns anddifficulties,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,i was satisfied with this course but i suggest that the workload of the class and the number of challenging problems might be reducedanother option could be to give challenging ungraded problems that we work through in the class for example you make as much progress on it as you can in the homework then review it in class that wasan approach that we took in some of my physics and math courses in college,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
13666,i think that adding in ways to force people to read the book would be good also to make it clear early on in the course that this course definitely has prerequisites in practice even if it doesnt in registration,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,very knowledgeable and good at teaching however some of the complex concepts needs a little more explanation as sometimes hes a bit quick paced,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,i think he is very good at giving more context to the things we learn on class like dfs and bfs applications on graphs and stuff i think it is more engaging when i know what i can do with what he teach i learneda lot from the class even though i might get a terrible grade but i learned,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,integrate a richer variety of engaging teaching resources including animations illustrative images and videos to enhance the learning experience,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,has clear concept and have the full understanding of the course materials he can understand what student wants to communicate easily keeps the class interactive so student doesnt feel a one waylearning,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
15377,he help to facilitate a better learning environment when he firmly ensured that we raised our hands when he asked questions in class during the first lectures tryhard students would shout out answersbefore anyone else had a chance to process the question or have the time to come up with an answer especially as a student without a cs background this was incredibly intimidating the professor didwell on shutting that down,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,he records his classes and they are available all the time for us to revisit,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,better explanation,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,professor know well of the course material class is engaging and fun,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,he and his teaching assistants will be very patient and helpful if you dont know how to do it please ask and let them know they will be very patient and enthusiastic to help you,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think the instructor needs to provide better materials especially for exams he gave the practice for the final much sooner than the midterm so he does seem to listen to feedback,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,v easy to understand his teaching v easy to approach him with doubts and questions,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think soheil did a great job facilitating inclusive learning there are no suggestions i have for this aspect of his course,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,teaching clearly is his biggest strength,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i had hard time trying to understand the concept of the topic most of the time,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think the instructor made an effort to answer any questions the students had in class,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,enthusiastic,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,there seemed to be a difference in the expectation of answers for homework assignments this was evident when comparing the expectation that was set when assignment was released against thesolution key released after the deadlineif we can bridge the gap in terms of reducing the expectations on student answers to be at the level of the answer key that can save me some time being spent on assignments,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,please make the teaching more better,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,work on more problem solving sessions difficulty level of problems solved in class and given in exams was not the same,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think prof behnezhad did a good job of explaining the material but i wish the pacing of the course was a little faster in the first half as it felt rushed to get in all the material as we approached the midtermwhich in term made it difficult to prepare,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,be more prepared you were lost couple of times loved examples and level of questions please keep goingadd a project application is required to understand conecpt,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,all good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,instructor is patient and helpful,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,prof is really good a graphs and explaining the concepts,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i dont know about inclusive i guess just make sure that students who require more time on quizzes get the time allotted but other than that good stuff,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the instructor is absolutely fantastic,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,hwk 2 was so close to the midterm and i didnt have enough time to revisit previous topics neither check if my answers were on the right track,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,na see prior answers,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,give more time on exams or change to online exam instead of writing code with hand,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,he is a passionate instructor he can explain the material well and the test is well aligned with the class material,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,is very good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the lectures and notes are all really good whenever i needed to remember the specifics of a lecture i could always go back through the notes to write something down i had forgotten,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think the coursework was really well organized and i felt that i was able to follow along pretty easily if there was something that i missed or if i couldnt make it to class i could easily figure out what to dothe assignments and tests were fair and grading was rather quick so you could get feedback quickly and figure out which areas to improvethe lectures sometimes felt a little disorganized andor the pace was too fast to follow along this could be because of how i prefer to learn but i think more examples of algorithms applied in real life andorpictorial demonstrations of how these algorithms would work andor just slowing down and really explaining each step and why we are doing them when introducing a new algorithm would be really helpful infollowing along,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,soheil is a really nice guy and a good instructor i found him to be very passionate about the material and he was always very good about answering questions both in class and online,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,he went through the algorithms but didnt formally prove them in class so it was tough to try to formally prove algorithms on the homework when we didnt get much instruction on how to make formalproofs,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the instructor has the clarity about the topics he covered in the class he explanation of difficult concepts are great signifying his good grasp on the course materials the instructor encouraged classroomdiscussions providing students a platform to think and come up with ideas to tackle problems at hand,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,na,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,takes students feedbacks and acts on it promptly,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,na,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,his patience kind friendly and solidness of knowledge i only hope that there could be a little more review sessions and code sessions,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,if it is possible take some time after each class to discuss about materials,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i have no idea at the moment,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,soheil is obviously very passionate about this subject and that is reflected in his teaching i got the feeling that he wasnt just reading us notes off slides but rather that he really wanted us to understand thetopics i think sometimes he would move a little quickly through things and students do not always feel comfortable asking questions in larger classes so sometimes they would fall behind but overall soheilwas a great professor,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the professor ensured clear and inclusive communication which enhanced the learning process,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,professor soheil did great in this area i hope i can take his other classes before i graduate,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the course is very hard for an align student if the professor could provide more basic knowledge for them it would be excellent,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think the teacher is very detailed and also gives bonus questions during the exam which i think are good considering the different basics of the students,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,just make it harder,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the professor used only very outdated teaching policies and methods to teach the course which are known proven through many research studies and practice to be highly ineffective especially forrigorous mathematicallogical instruction the instructor was obviously unprepared for instruction in the method he chose which was also a poor outdated method he needs to read these researcharticles to learn how to teach and the effective methods for teaching as well as talk with the other instructors at khoury who already know these things and can help him understand i suggest removing himfrom the instruction of a required course and have him teach only electives while he builds his skills and preparedness for this course i would ask for my money back if i could for this poor quality ofinstructionthis course if taught this way should not be a mandatory class and should be an elective it lacked a focus on making the students better professionals which is an overall focus of the rest of the degree itwas misaligned with the degree objectives it verged on uninclusiveness with outdated policies and procedures which are harmful for neurodivergent identified or not people minorities and typicallyunderrepresented peoplethe professor made completing this trace evaluation part of timed quiz without telling us in advance that it was part of this particular quiz and it having other questions i was given less than 30 minutesto fill out this evaluation after answering the other technical questions of the quiz i typically spend at least an hour on trace evals so please keep in mind i have more to say and would have edited for clarityif i was allowed to complete this on my own time,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the homework is difficult and need extra self learning it can include more coding exercise and less algoritm proof,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,na,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,inclusiveness seemed fine,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i understand it is his first semester teaching so there are challenges that come with that and i can empathize with the difficulties of doing so however i am still paying a lot of money for a course and do notwant to be a guinea pig for a professor to sort things out i think the university should put more effort into monitoring and providing guidance and resources to new professors so it can be a positiveexperience for both the students and professor changes were made over the course of the semester which made the overall experience a bit better but it is incredibly frustrating when it took the first halfof the course to sort things out,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
21011,he is very nice and kind and he records every class so u can watch these records many times until u fully understand,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
35058,every one should take a class from prof aloupis hes an excellent teacher this was one of the hardest classes ive taken and im not going to get a great grade in it but it was definitely the most worthwhileive taken at northeastern i learned so much that will benefit me throughout my career and i will retain it because we were taught how to understand the material rather than just memorize it,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,great powerpoint summary and course notes,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,grading scale was confusing,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,all lectures should be recorded over a powerpoint like his new videos are done and he should replace the videos from many years ago exams should be much less unfairly challenging,"Aloupis, Gregory"
37459,im not really sure what this means in this context,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,in class teaching and presentation,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,professor take his class seriously wellprepared and answer students questions well,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,he understand students and how to effectively communicate with them,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,spend more time explaining difficult aspects in the course reduce random discussion time in class and focus the discussion within the incomprehensible knowledge aspects,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,he was always willing to listen and talk to everyones ideas and was very inclusive to all answers,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,i firmly believe that in two years taking this class with raj is going to be the best way to go its clear that hes newer to teaching this course and courses i general but he clearly cares a ton and is a goodlecturer so when it all comes together into a finished product it will be great its just a matter of when,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,the instructors punctuality and organized course outline contributed positively to inclusivity however to enhance inclusivity further the instructor could incorporate more interactive elements toaccommodate diverse learning preferences and ensure all students feel engaged and valued in the learning process,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,i think that the professor already does everything necessary regarding inclusive learning he is easily reachable online and he responds very quickly he is transparent about how and why he teaches theway he does and he readily answers questions and fosters an open environment in which to ask questions even just to repeat something he already said,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,i really enjoyed how the professor made the class and the topics interesting and engaging always excited to learn new things this wayadd prerecord lecture sections that have examples available on canvas there are already youtube videos that explain similarly but it helps if professors can relate them to other topics from classadd calculations and formula work into slides rather than board similar yet different formulas writing them out seemed repetitive at times and confusing took a lot of class time,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
40214,great class with useful class content,"Sun, Zhifeng"
40214,improve recording,"Sun, Zhifeng"
40214,the instructor is doing fine for this class,"Sun, Zhifeng"

17364,nothing yet,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17364,the class environment felt extremely inclusive,"Mwaura, Jonathan"

17600,this is my second course with professor hamandi her teaching is the best i have come across her lectures are structured very well she does in great job in ensuring that all students are following alongshe dissects complex topics and explains them very well to first time users i would 100 take all her courses if given the chance,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,she is organized keeps the course engaging communicative friendly,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,the workload is a little big,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,very inclusive,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,all good,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,i felt comfortable in this class due to the small class size and ability to askanswer questions at any point i never felt like i could not ask a question regardless of how simple it was professor hamandi fostersa very inclusive learning environment and is always willing to take time to help us through questionsassignments,"Hamandi, Lama"
17371,the videos filmed in 2016 are outdated and hard to follow please re record those sections,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,speaking with the instructor felt fruitless at one point a student posted in our discussion board about adding 5 or 10 minutes to the exam length and the professor said no because it was his understandingthat those who did not perform well under that time limit did so because they didnt understand the topics and not because they didnt have enough time thats possible sure but when a b is given to astudent with a 40 in the class then i think something needs to be reworkedi really do like professor aloupis teaching style like i said above i would come away from each video feeling like i understood the material i have four separate notebooks full of notes from this course ispent hours on this material each week all to culminate in one of the worst averages ive ever had in a classmaybe im an outlier in this experience but i feel like im not considering the overall average of the class,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,no need for improvement,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,null,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,good material easy to followcoding would be more practical in this course,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,good,"Aloupis, Gregory"
40215,sometimes certain subjects are hard to understand so i think more examples are needed but they should be drawn in a clear and neat way and not all over the place it makes understanding for the firsttime a little easier when we can go back and look at the examples we did in class,"Lee, Hyonho"
40215,wv klervhoerivpoer,"Lee, Hyonho"
40215,the instructor knew the material well more time could have been spent teaching in lecture instead of reading off of lecture slides lecture slides can be read by students outside of class,"Lee, Hyonho"
40407,na,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
40407,the instructor delivers clear and helpful teaching material reflecting significant effort it helps in understanding complex concepts effectively,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
37894,i was able to answer all assignments using python rather than straight math as other algo teachers have required i am most comfortable demonstrating my knowledge and understanding of the material inpython rather than math proofs for me math proofs are akin to writing in a language i dont speak fluently i appreciate the ability to use the language and format that enables me to most accuratelyexpress my understanding of the material especially given that the course is a computer science course,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,i dont think there is much to do,"Kennedy, Justin"

35265,provide lectures for all topics with more understandable explanations,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35265,the instructor is extremely knowledgeable and helpful and helped through all the queries and doubts i had during the course the instructor could focus more on covering different topics in the class whichwould provide a more understanding of the subject and also help in the assignments also for a topic questions similar to problem sets could be provided for personal practice of students so that they couldenhance their subject knowledge,"Mwaura, Jonathan"

20302,na,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,this course is really helpful for preparing for an sde interview professor mukunds insights and teachings have been particularly helpful i have gained a wealth of knowledge from the content she hasshared however the homework appears to extend beyond the class content presenting a challenge and we need a significant amount of time and effort to complete it if the professor could explain theassignments or possibly reduce the difficulty level it would greatly enhance the learning experience i really appreciate the professors guidance and believe that such adjustments would further contributeto the success of the course thank you,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,shes doing a pretty good job shes my favorite professor at northeastern so far i love that she uses inclass handwriting notes to teach not just slides moreover including examples during algointroduction from beginnerfriendly to more advanced the approach help me a lot,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,as mentioned above if her organizational skills could be improved especially regarding assignments and lectures this would be helpful,"Mukund, Smruthi"
40408,thank you so much for your instructions,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,the instructor has been hardworking in helping students get a strong grasp on the topic for both the common and advanced topics in the algorithm design and analysis field he knew when students couldhave difficulties preparing themselves before class during those topics and he had made videos to explain part of the topics in great details,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,the knowledge of real working experience the practical teaching style is really helpful,"Rad, Ryan"

21186,his style of teaching is fresh and can pretty confidently answer most questions that arise but simultaneously acknowledges when he doesnt know something,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,anyway the rajagopal is a good teacher trying to help students if he can improve the set of quiz and homework it will be better,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,strengths the reading materials are a very good way of expanding my knowledgeareas of improvement people who have no idea of ai need to do a lot of postlecture studies to keep up this could be brought down to a minimum glace of the lecture notes basic revision one way that ibelieve would work is to plan the way to present the material,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i know for a fact that inclusiveness is one of his core teaching principles and i noticed that he strives for it i dont think its possible to facilitate a better learning environment,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"

21186,instructor has good knowledge of the subject and is a good teacher who promotes interactions in class,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,as mentioned above if professor took recitation sessions or something of that kind and gave exercises to practise it would be very useful for a student to become better in the course,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,he was pretty good for someone who taught his first semester as an undergrad and grad professor he could work on making the class a little more interactive and maybe include labsrecitations from thenext semester onwards,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,the instructor is very friendly open to answering questions and discussions they are very approachable and are very active on campuswire which is really helpful from an assignments point of viewthe instructor must provide more study material ensure tas adhere to their office hours timings and have more rigidity and structure in the overall course,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,intuitive way of teaching very wellprepared slides with carefully pickedout examples,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i have autism and have a hard time learning and picking up content in a lot of my classes but he made the classroom and extremely inclusive environment for all you could ask questions any time and henever displayed any form of frustration or disapproval i cant give higher praise for a khoury processor at northeastern he definitely is one of the highlights of my college experience,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186, really enjoyed the teaching style and keeping the class interesting probably for the same one or two students asking redundant questions it could be helpful for all the other students to tell them to take the discussion after the class,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,professor is knowledgeable but the course lacked structure were paying a lot of money for each course its reasonable to expect the instructor to have the course material ready and have a clear plan foreach lecture i regret taking this course but didnt have an option as its a core course for my program i suggest the professor to take a semester off to thoroughly prepare lectures and then resumeteaching the course,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,na,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i also was very confused at how to adapt the concepts into practice code and would have benifited from more examples but was greatful for the extra time the proffessor took in his office hours whichcounteracted this drawback for me,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"

17387,he seems to be understanding of students needs and was responsive to constructive criticism about the workload for assignment 2,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,1 the grading rubric is not clear in this class and different tas graded the assignments with different standards which provided inconsistency regarding the grading2 it would be nice if late days can be offered since sometimes things happen in life for example a total of 10 days can be offered to each student starting each semesters it would allow students to finishthe assignments more thoroughly instead of rushing it,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,the teacher recorded the lesson it is convenient for students to review and those who cannot attend class in time,"Annunziato, Jose"

17387,everything is good,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,the tas racial ratio is odd why are there no chinese tas even though approximately half of the students in this course are chinese and there are many chinese students in our university i believe there isnot enough representation,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,it is hard to do the assignment and the project at the same time it could be better to assign the assignment in the first couples of weeks and give us at least a mouth to complete the project with no need todo any assignment,"Annunziato, Jose"

10855,the instructor is a very knowledgeable person but i think he should not look at every person in the classroom equally maybe not everyone can match the expectation that he has set i personally faced a lotof issues he should consider all ends of the spectrum,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,professor shesh excels as a storyteller seamlessly weaving programming concepts into engaging narratives or games during his lectures this unique approach not only facilitates a deeper understandingof the material but also adds an enjoyable element to the classroom experience the class appreciates and enjoys his teaching style making the learning process both effective,"Shesh, Amit"
10855, it would be great if the tas could have a bit more clarity on what the assignment description rather than having to read the assignment while the student is waiting in the queue i feel the flow of the course could have been tweaked a bit to accommodate all the things that weve learned in the assignmentsall the design patterns taught after mvc were not tested thoroughly the time spent during initial lectures could probably be cut down so that atleast a few new design patterns could have been included intime for assignment 5,"Shesh, Amit"

11550,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,but there is really a lot of homework and its still a struggle for me to master so many skills in a short period of time especially final project because basically the skills needed to be able to actually startbuilding a standalone website are taught at the very end and although you can start very early you can really only start doing it at the end of the semester for someone like me who doesnt have a webfoundation it was a really big workload for me in this class,"Annunziato, Jose"

37421,the instructors ability to create an inclusive and respectful classroom environment was a significant strength they consistently acknowledged diverse viewpoints and encouraged participation from allstudents which fostered a sense of community and belonging however there is room for improvement in adapting teaching materials to be more inclusive of different learning styles and abilities forinstance providing materials in multiple formats such as visual aids audio recordings and interactive activities could help accommodate students with varying needs and preferences,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,he did not explain concepts widely  he need to improvement in teaching the basics of the concepts,"Mitra, Joydeep"

35156,the instructor was not optimal and needs more training a little ml joke for you chrispeople were often lost in class due to a lack of clarity of walking through concepts during lectures and for explaining vague wording in the homework problems there was deafening silence in class when hewould ask questions because he was not good at breaking down the material for students who dont have the same mental connections as someone who has phd in this fieldhe was too lazy to check homework assignments that he took from professor raj venkat and we suffered from typos and vague wording all the time which made the homework less effective for learninghe was an absent father in piazza along with most of the tas but even they showed up more than he did overall there was low accountability for the tas to actively help students so we would often have torepeatedly post or bump posts in piazza there were huge logistical oversights not using the khoury office hours sandbox website to conduct queuestyle office hours online chris not booking rooms foroffice hours tas moving office hours frequently or just not being present it was a nightmare to get the support you needed and after talking with my peers a lot of us just relied on each other and selfstudied berkleys materials its crazy that without berkleys online cs188 content i wouldve failed the course its even crazier that im paying thousands of dollars for lower quality education to teachmyself everything online from another school anyway some professors are just meant for research and not for teaching and chris amato is definitely one of them chris one could say you overfit theresearch environment and can not generalize enough to do well teach in the testing environment the classroom another ai joke womp womp,"Amato, Christopher"
