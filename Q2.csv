10685,more solved questions would have been super helpful i believe i would have done significantly better if this was available,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,the assignments were a bit lengthy in some weeks and especially the weeks leading to the midterm and end term exams i felt the time spent in typesetting the assignment could have better been utilizedstudying for the exam,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,provide some kind of pre requisite brush up materials the initial days were full of math and i really struggled to find the rhythm i completed by bachelors 6 years ago and the last time i studied math was 7years ago so was finding it a little hard to follow along the math was nothing new just that i was out of touch for a long period and the class was fast paced,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,do some more background concepts coverage for people who are not having the sufficient prereq else the course becomes too heavy,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,sometimes i feels like the professor wants to make the course hard simply for the sake of making the course hard not to challenge the students directly in addition i wish we had more time in the classdevoted to solving problems rather than just lecture however i do understand that we were very short on time and taking time out of lecture to do this might not be possible,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685, since this is the undergraduate section of graduate algorithms do not just brush over concepts that we shouldve learned in undergraduate when this is the section specifically meant for people whohavent taken it before make the homework and midterms more relevant to what we actually go over in class i understand graduate courses are more independent but it should not be to the extent where i can only do 1 of thehomeworkquestions based on what i learned in class and the rest i have to teach myself or teach the material that will be on the homeworkmidterm in class return homework grades and regrades back in a timely manner it is impossible to assess how well we understand the material if we dont know our grade more often than not students piazza questions are unanswered and it is very difficult to get help and feedback the midterm is incredibly unproductive and does not evaluate how well we know the material in the class just how well we knew one specific topic that we had yet to receive sufficient feedback on lessthan 10 of the class got above a 50 and even with a curve the average was still failing  8 hours is too long for an exam with 6 questions that doesnt even assess most of what we have learned,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,nothing,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,the instructor cannot do much to make the course better as he already does a lot at a very high level that is both inducive to learning and material retention,"Pavlu, Virgil"
10685,i think that the professor could take his time going through topics like dynamic programming with much more detail too often we would go over an example and then never fully complete it he would explainthe theory but not go over the pseudocode which made it difficult to visualize how to actually implement the solution to the problemthe professor likes students who come into algorithms with a good background knowledge of the subject this is understandable as it is a masters class however many undergraduates were taking thisclass as part of the plusone program as an undergraduate coming into the class with no algorithms background it made it very difficult to follow along and learn the topics properly the professoracknowledged that there were undergraduates in the class but made very little effort to help them he often said that we should have seen this exercise in undergrad even though we had never taken analgorithms class before the resources on the class webpage were very limited as a result i had to find my own materials to teach the topics to myself the professor needs to take the time to help all of hisundergraduate and graduate students with these topics he needs to explain them more instead of skipping over key detailsmultiple times throughout the semester we would not learn a concept until the day the homework was due this happened with topics like memoization as well as prim and kruskals algorithms so we had lessthan 12 hours to use the information we learned in class to complete the homeworkunfortunately i feel like i did not learn much from this class i was constantly struggling to keep up with the material so i fell behind several times i felt like the youtube videos i found did a better job ofexplaining the concepts than the lecture did,"Pavlu, Virgil"
30569,provide better resources for preparing for exams the two exams compromised 60 of my final grade and covered so much content that i wasnt sure what to study it would have been helpful to havesample exams to know what kind of questions to expect it would have also been helpful to have in class or out of class review sessions in the week leading up to the exam to ask questions and gainclarification,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,he could keep online recordings,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,post lecture notes before hand,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,put slides up preclass,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,make the lectures available online it is 2024 and classroomonly lectures only cause inconvenience as there is no way of looking back at something that was missed,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,maybe try to keep class size as small as possible but i think this is not the problem of instructor,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,recordings of lectures,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,i wish exams were weighted slightly less and assignments weighted slightly more,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,i dont think this is really on the instructor but the course content probably could have gone a bit deeper i took the course as an undergraduate student hoping that it would skip me past a lot of the basicdata structuresalgorithms you learn in high school ap cs but we ultimately spent a lot of time going over things that i would have expected a graduate class to expect preexisting knowledge ofalso grading on homework wasnt always the best though this is on the tas more than the instructor the regrade request system made it so issues could ultimately be resolved but there were many timesthat it was annoying that there was even an issue in the first place and some grading choices had me questioning the graders literacy,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,all good,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,great course,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,post the lecture notes before the class during oh explain concepts in a different way,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,the only real part of the course i would change would be to release the notes before the class lectures i find in my other classes that reviewing the notes beforehand helps me absorb the information duringclass more easily,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,he could give us some optional practice questions,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
30569,preferably spend some more time going in depth explaining what is going on with the algorithm and make sure people understand complicated ideas,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
37414,either give more time for the assignments or maybe reduce the difficulty level student who are fresh grad from college have a tough time in this subject something needs to be done to make it easier forthem i definitely learned a lot from the course but it was mentally draining,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,first there is no room for accommodation in this class you get a set number of late days and can only use one late day for an assignment i had a life situation come up that i had to take time to deal withand the professor offered an extension but later in the semester he refused to accept my assignment a little bit late despite me mentioning the extension that i didnt use i dont want to bend the rules butit felt ridiculous that i had justification for not having enough time and how hard me and my partner worked to finish up immediately after the deadline resulted in 0 credit for that worki think the workload is unreasonable especially when the nonstop projects assignments start coming up this class doesnt take into consideration that we are students with other classes andresponsibilities all of the assignments take 20 hours each and this is on top of weekly labs selfevaluations and code walks a new assignment is released every 2 weeks with no breaks most of the 2 weeksfor the first assignment was spring break so we had to work during the break one of the required portions was to write tests and we didnt have the lecture on how to test these kinds of programs until theday before the deadline it seemed unreasonable to expect us to make a fully functional modelviewcontroller mvc program with a user interface with no starter code when from lecture we only had thesimplest code examples of mvc,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,some of the grading rubric with respect to assignments focus more on other aspects as compared to design of the code more weightage can be given to the way the features are implemented or thestructure of the code,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,decrease the ambiguity in the assignment instructionsrefactor the ta selection process as the ones this semester were mostly misleading to what was expected most of all the newly appointed tas  in fact some of their suggestion cost a lot points to a fewstudentshave a better grading system where students can understand their mistakes in the first assignment and learn from them rather than finding out about the issue in the last few assignmentsplease mention it early about any new library to be used as learning a whole new ui library in few days at end sem would be challenging for students new to it while those who have previously worked on thelibrary will walk through it like a breeze creating an unjust handicaplet the tas know more about the assignments as some of their suggestions or replies were outright rejected when asked to the professor which means no one can be confident over the tas guidancehave a strict and clear scoring system where in if one student lost points due to certain reasons everyone else should too or else no one else shouldand scoring based on lot of things other than design has caused students to ineffectively spend more time in those things due to being scared of loosing points due to some unrelated unmentioned issue,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,mention all the desired outcomes in the assignment since students usually cannot assume what might be present in the rubric but not in the assignment i know that in real life clients do not specifyeverything but still there should be a hint in the assignment at least because a student cannot implement lot more things not asked in the assignment just by assuming some of them might be in the rubric,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,if the workload is slightly lighter,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,please make 1 or 2 lectures on how to write test cases i am really sad with the fact that i lost most of my grades on test cases and hence the students further should not go through the same please includea lecture for test cases,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,there was a factor of uneven workload distribution in the last 4 group assignments i do not know how one would tackle this but it is a concurrent issue also i think the course should have mandatedimplementation of at least 2 design patterns in the assignments,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,some assignments were ambiguous and were not clear making the requirements clear in assignments would great,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,teaching the topics that come in handy for assignments before the assignment is released,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,provide clear and reasonable rubrics train unified scoring ta,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,i liked the way the course topics were taught by the professor the professor kept the class very engaging and the concepts were explained clearly and in an easy to understand way,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the assignment descriptions could have been a little more descriptive in certain cases highlighting clearly what was expected of us,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,make the deadlines at midnight instead of 9pm i dont see the point of making it earlier because some assignments are not graded immediately as students we have more time at night because we spendtime commuting during the day,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the course even though being good was a bit fast paced maybe its just me but for the most part i tend to fell behind since java was new for me i only knew the basics and also being a fresher i had noexperience with oops or the various models that were taught in some places i felt that the labs even though taught a necessary skill that would be beneficial for the main assignments they used to come alittle late and i was not able implement those in the assignment maybe that is just me and others might not have felt this way,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,reduce the assignments please people have other courses to do make the deadline at 12 why 9 we need more time with other work as well this was way too much work also reduce the weight of thejava doc its cuts way too much into our grade and its hard to fix all of it before the deadline,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the ta grading for each assignment could have been better and the rubric and requirements for certain assignments,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,along with the grades instructor can also release the rubric used for grading to make the grading process more transparent also some extracredit or leniency in rubrick can be shown so that studentsdont lose grades for small things,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,nothing,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,the instructors depth of knowledge in java and foundational programming principles is commendable and provides a strong basis for understanding key concepts however the reliance on java as theprimary language throughout the course may not align with the evolving preferences and needs of the current generation of students as the tech industry shifts towards more diverse programmingenvironments it becomes increasingly important for educational curricula to reflect this diversity and not remain confined to any single language this approach would not only make the learning moreinclusive but also more applicable to modernday programming contexts equipping students with the versatility needed in todays varied tech landscape,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,offer a chance for extra credit or a grading curve each assignment is strictly graded with no opportunity for recourse if a student takes longer to grasp the material fully in this way the course greatlyrewards students who are ahead of the curve so to speakthose who clearly understand material the first timeand this course consequently offers less reward to students who may need repeatedexposure to design topics before successfully implementing them in assignmentsone specific improvement may be to allow for some labs to be paced even further ahead of the applicable topic within the homework assignments thereby allowing students to practice the designtechniques earlier so that the techniques can be applied more readily in assignments the labs seemed to be paced slightly behind assignments so some topics were only sinking in just at the end or evenafterwards of the applicable assignment submission window,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,better communicate the objectives of the homework assignments as there were things that points were taken off for that was not part of the assignment description a lot of the homework assignmentsalso had details that were from previous years and were confusing to read it would be helpful to structure the assignments in such a way that students are not stuck with their partners for multipleassignments,"Shesh, Amit"
37414,1 more concise assignment expectations and rubrics2 consistent grading by different tas every ta had different assumptions on the grading rubricafter a weeks worth of effort i would love to see that im graded consistently with the same rubric by all tas,"Shesh, Amit"
41152,class time is short only 1h of class and 1h of recitationcant feel the real interation with professor and classmates since its online,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,na,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,no more he is perfect,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,we need more office hours also please see if you can stop using teams for this course it is almost impossible to find any single thread or specific comment in teams nothing is specifically organized by weekor topic in teams use something like piazza or campuswire,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,it would be better to have more examples during class,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,canvas announcements are more organized than teamsit is better to put the github classroom link to accept the assignment in the assignments part in canvas otherwise it is hard to find the links to accept homework in github classrooma lot of people only check the resources part in modules at the beginning of the semester because it is located at the top of all modules and is automatically collapsed as more and more modules are addedthrough the semester updating the resources module should come with a notice on canvas otherwise people tend to not noticing the change,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,prep some sort of documentation where we could practice building basic apps from scratch on a weekly basis alongside posting weekly videos explaining the concepts,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,im satisfied with everything,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
41152,maybe more examples of implementations of different scenarios i know its implicit but like a blog system and a todo list are different in some ways and therere different ways to interact with databasesyncasync when to update the items etc and a bit more assignments to practice them,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
36915,met more often throughout the week,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,while the live coding examples were helpful sometimes things could get a bit repetitive perhaps having some of the code available to demonstrate live and having other almost identical operations alreadyfinished and just briefly reviewed would allow us to cover more material,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,he did very well the homeworks were very timeconsuming but you come out the other side more confident because you have learned a lot,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,i wish the instructor could have more ohs as tas sometimes cannot really find what the bug  problem is,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,transparency on the rubric there is basically no way for the student to understand what is happening with the grading unless we approach a ta in their office hours it improved over the duration of thecourse but would be great if it is the norm,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,out of the instructors control but it would have been nice to either have a few more tas or a smaller amount of students it was often very difficult to get in contact with a ta based on the volume ofstudents attending office hours,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,there were never enough tas for the amount of people having trouble ive lost count of how many times i queued up to try and join office hours sat in the queue for four hours then got kicked out of thequeue once office hours had endedi felt incredibly ripped off by the textbook i was required to purchase it to answer a single question on one of the homework assignments and the answer just required me to copy and paste a block of textfurthermore the text of the textbook seemed to be identical to the homework so i paid 75 to get one question answeredthe lectures went way too fast for me dranunziado clearly knows his stuff but there was no way for me to keep up and codealong with the lecture especially since he was using ai to fill out big chunks ofthe code which i was unable to copy down by hand i spent so much time trying to keep up with him that i missed a lot of what he was talking aboutfinally the assignments felt simultaneously too easy and too hard there was a lot of what felt like busywork to me the labs seem designed to be completed purely by copying and pasting dranunziadoscode,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,personally i dont think the professor delivered an efficient lecture his lecture was solely based on live coding we know this based on the lab section on the homework but three hours of live coding makesthe lecture inefficient explaining concepts using slides before each live coding is probably better,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,assignments are a bit heavy maybe make them a bit more simple,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,make sure that the instructions on the homework assignment actually work before giving out the homework,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,though the assignments instructions are often very clear i still wish that the assignment has a grading rubric and also maybe decrease the amount of work asked for first two assignments its a lot ofrepetitive work and i feel like the amount of time i dedicated to these two and the amount of stuff i learned is not quite worth it only for the first two assignments,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,i think the course is already as good as it can be,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,more accurate code in homeworks,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,honestly i think that this course is not a good candidate for the onceweek time block i understand why it exists and why it works for some peoples schedules after all i took it however 3h 20minutes is alot given the sheer amount of material,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,better logistics for the course faced a lot of logistics issues the tas were rarely available when required skipped during submission days and a lot of late assignment evaluation which turned out a lot atthe end of the course,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,ask tas show up in their office hour the khoury q is never open the zoom meeting never starts,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,make the piazza more organized as it is very cluttered and most of the important announcements and details relateed to course are missed and not clearly conveyed,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,he is the best professor at least until now,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,make the piazza more organized its too spammed with instructor notes which kind of makes it hard to keep track of important announcements,"Annunziato, Jose"
36915,this is the best,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,reduce workload from students especially in the finals week it can lead to stress we have two quizzes one exam one assignment plus a project to deliver in a week which makes it hectic along with otherclasses,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159, clearly communicate his office hour schedules and additional sessions improve coordination and communication with tas to ensure consistency increase responsiveness to student inquiries on piazza emails and teams messages enforce policies consistently to maintain fairness for instance ensuring that missed quizzes or exams are not typically allowed to be retaken as stated in the syllabus implement better monitoring of office hour queues for both himself and his tas to ensure smoother and more efficient assistance for students,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,assignment instruction should be more clear and concise that help students easy to follow the instructions for asignments sometimes were not correct with cost time for students to understand and followalso if allowing student to take project individually instructor should assign doable and manageable workload for them to complete i had not too much time to complete the project by myself due tostruggling of completing previous assignment,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,i feel getting tailwind css somewhere along the course can make it more exciting,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,none,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,the instruction for setting up environment and deployment to cloud aatlas has some errors students may feel confusing and hard to follow up,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,nothing ,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,have more office hours  there was problem with my code and since there are many ta office hours i went to a bunch of them no ta was able to solve the problem i had to wait a week to reach theinstructor for his office hour because he doesnt have regularly scheduled office hour it took the instructor only five minutes to fix my issue so i wasted all that time asking the ta i wish the ta quality isbetter and i want the instructor to have regular office hours so that no one waste time,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,i hope the code and steps in the homework can be thoroughly proofread,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,i love this course in its current format,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,good enough for me,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,make weightage for exams less,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,the class is heavily disorganized expectations for assignments are super unclear very impersonal with the professor assignments unnecessarily detailed and cumbersome strongly takes away fromlearning,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,please a more reliable guide file there are too many typos in it which makes me struggling every assignment,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,the tas need to notify students in advance of any rescheduling of office hours instead of being noshows when students are waiting this is particularly crucial for students who require assistance withsubmitting their homework before the deadline additionally it would be beneficial to receive grading earlier allowing students to use the feedback to improve their subsequent assignments,"Annunziato, Jose"
35159,please communicate the requirements for each assignment and project better and please make certain that tas are clear on when they will and wont be available in office hours,"Annunziato, Jose"
21104,use class time better i feel like only the first 20 and the last 40 minutes of class time were useful we spent a lot of time sidetracked on nonimportant things,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,make the lottery more fair i guess some people didnt get a turn for 34 classes,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,when doing the living coding slow down a little bit,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,everything was good but sometimes as a beginner coder i felt like i was expected to know so much so fast,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,sometimes the strengths come to the cost of organization i enjoyed the idea of the recorded mid term and the lottery but the lack of communication over the mid term made scheduling stressful i alsothink the lottery needs some tweaking maybe in the framing only it made the class feel punishing more than anything although i do think there could be something valuable in this system,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,i think the professor really did a great work already,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,make deadlines longer and make some changes to make up for the project,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,sometimes the class can be quite stressful for introverted individuals like myselfi dont get any feedback from the assignmenthaving a project demo before we begin can greatly aid in our understanding and execution of the project,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,he is a bit unorganized,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,sometimes the course is way too informative and its a little bit overwhelming also sometimes the concept is way too deep and i cannot really understand and easily lost i hope the learning curve can benot that sharp,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,na,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,the only thing i feel like is that theres too much materials but too little time for the course it would have been better if we can become more specialized in some areas,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,na,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,i feel like this class covered too much which makes me feel like i have a surfacelevel understanding of these concepts it would be helpful to maybe divide lectures into portions where topics are brokendown more more of a theoretical explanation and then are implemented through live coding this way it is much easier to understand the flow of concepts and how they are interconnected moreanalogies and demonstrations would be helpful also it could be helpful to have group discussions on topics to discuss newlylearned concepts with peers to learn from others and be comfortable relayinginformation to others effectively,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
21104,maybe give more time to complete projectshaha,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20297,use class time better i feel like only the first 20 and the last 40 minutes of class time were useful we spent a lot of time sidetracked on nonimportant things,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"

39710,i honestly think the prof did teach everything perfectly,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,maybe she can publish the answer after grading the problemset to hlep students understand whats wrong,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,i dont like professor calls on students to answer questions during class,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,the problem sets are challenging and sometimes doesnt has sufficient materials to support the completion or thinking and the math takes a great portion of the problem set if the course can give morecredits for leetcode problems and analyze those problem that associated with textbooks lectures that will be even more helpful for students,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,na,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,optional quizzes before the class to help us study and get an understanding of what we dont understand that way during class we can ask questions and can prepare better for actual quizzes andassignments,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,lecture is mostly repeating what ive already learned in reading,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,good,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,moving outside the module quizzes and teaching beyond the concepts in coursework,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,the homework the two tests the seminar presentation and the final project are too much for me,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,maybe workload can be more balanced,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,na,"Hamandi, Lama"
39710,less discussions about easy question,"Hamandi, Lama"
40399,i think this is the most enjoyable course i have ever taken at northeastern university the teachers put their best effort into teaching the course he is already the best the only thing that needs to bementioned is that please give more confidence and encouragement to students they will do very well with your helpin my opinion he is not worthy of being a teacher he is more of a mentor guiding us on the road to success,"Hoshino, Richard"
40399,less assignments,"Hoshino, Richard"
40399,cant think of any,"Hoshino, Richard"
40399,not much,"Hoshino, Richard"
40399,try to make it a cs course instead of a math course the materials is really hard but most of thing is not covered during class please use time efficiently and bring more example when we try to learnsomething new,"Hoshino, Richard"
39706,keep syllabus uptodate ensure assignments are posted promptly to online channels ensure students are able to submit assignments to online channels provide grades in a timely manner so we can seewhere we stand,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,give more examples,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,the instructor could introduce ai more in programming than only math and theory and provide guidance on some handson projects in class play around with different models,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,he could post the homework and other important information in advance sometimes i felt the information was posted without enough notice in advance,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,1 use the assignment and grades section on canvas so that students can better manage the deadlinedue date and requirements of each assignment and understand how they perform2 release the assignments earlier so that students can better balance the coursework,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,the instructor should adhere to the syllabus timelines allowing students to effectively schedule their time for assignments and projects,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,he did a great job already,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,be more reachable and responsive through email communication sometimes it takes weeks to get response,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,update material ahead and provide more optional readings which might be interesting,"Saad, Nadim"
39706,maybe deflect student questions for the end of class so that he can cover more topics during the lecture,"Saad, Nadim"
20294,use class time better i feel like only the first 20 and the last 40 minutes of class time were useful we spent a lot of time sidetracked on nonimportant things,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"

20294,sometimes the strengths come to the cost of organization i enjoyed the idea of the recorded mid term and the lottery but the lack of communication over the mid term made scheduling stressful i alsothink the lottery needs some tweaking maybe in the framing only it made the class feel punishing more than anything although i do think there could be something valuable in this system,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,i think the professor really did a great work already,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,make deadlines longer and make some changes to make up for the project,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,sometimes the class can be quite stressful for introverted individuals like myselfi dont get any feedback from the assignmenthaving a project demo before we begin can greatly aid in our understanding and execution of the project,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,he is a bit unorganized,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,sometimes the course is way too informative and its a little bit overwhelming also sometimes the concept is way too deep and i cannot really understand and easily lost i hope the learning curve can benot that sharp,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,na,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,the only thing i feel like is that theres too much materials but too little time for the course it would have been better if we can become more specialized in some areas,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,na,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,i feel like this class covered too much which makes me feel like i have a surfacelevel understanding of these concepts it would be helpful to maybe divide lectures into portions where topics are brokendown more more of a theoretical explanation and then are implemented through live coding this way it is much easier to understand the flow of concepts and how they are interconnected moreanalogies and demonstrations would be helpful also it could be helpful to have group discussions on topics to discuss newlylearned concepts with peers to learn from others and be comfortable relayinginformation to others effectively,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20294,maybe give more time to complete projectshaha,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
20295,a better plan of instruction adjusting the approach when it is obvious that most people are not grasping the subject matter focus on students learning instead of just focusing on trying to cover as muchmaterial as possible with no one grasping it,"Veliz, Oscar"
20295,it would be nice for people with strict obligations outside of class to not have a punitive approach to attendance stream and record your lectures come with lecture slides prepared that you made yourself and posted before lecture begins so people can follow along and so that you are familiar with the exact packagesimplementations the studentswill need to interact with to avoid issues with versionsyntax changes maybe dont threaten students with spontaneous quizzes at the end of lectures to ensure people stay the whole time dont doubleup on assignments during the holidaysschoolbreaks because people are very busy and effectively lose their time for a break if given more homework during itmore generally though it would have been nice if the professor taught us how to write test files and had a homework dedicated to learning that skill reduced the pace of material introduction  hw was able to get grades posted quicker,"Veliz, Oscar"
17405,i think the classes where the professor has materialsnotes prepared beforehand go more smoothly the dynamic programming lecture stands out to me in my memory because the professor had broughtnotes for the tabulation algorithm to solve 01 knapsack what could have been a difficult algorithm to cover was made clear and simple by the advance preparation,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,i think adding more leetcode problems for assignments will be better,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,more flexible deadlines would have been nice,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,i cant think of anything,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,na,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,too much theoretical part of the course and the homework has been designed with too much proof questions i personally think we should focus more on how to use the theoretical part instead of beingasked to prove those which have been proved by the great people and we should stand on the great mans shoulder instead of sitting with them,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17405,1 i suggest clearer segregation of assignments on canvas particularly for students without zybooks access to avoid confusion2 more transparent grading criteria on gradescope would help students understand the rationale behind deducted points,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17388,too much to list,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,some flexibility in the release of course content so that we can plan our study sessions better,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,this was the worst course i have ever taken at northeastern as i said in the strength professor kennedy is a nice person but doesnt teach anythingthe videos are from another professor and are only 10 minutes each for very advanced topics professor kennedy doesnt grade the tas did i dont understand why he was paid for this course he held aweekly lecture that was usually an hour long where he simply went over the same slides as the module videos no additional context they were a waste and most people stopped watching themthe worst part was when you ask the professor a question about a homework assignment he wouldnt answer he wanted you to provide justification when turning in your homework as to what youassumed the problem may have been asking this guy is the worst professor at this schoolavoid at all costs you will spend 99 of your time on youtube or taking a coursera course to actually learn,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,the instructor could work on value add with his teams comments and the intro video he made each week for the video he often seemed to go over the slides directly which is what the course videos do sothey were not helpful,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,more space for project and deleting the homework for last two modules,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,it was hard to find the tas office hour schedule and there was no feedback on which parts of the assignment solutions were wrong it would be better to provide a dropin office hour schedule of tas andmore feedback when grading assignments,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,make it more lively or communicative sessions live classes,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,the best way to make this course better for the instructor is leave this position immidiately this instructor is not good at helping students with close followups and not able to handle large group ofstudents there are nearly no interactions or office hours and students has great difficuties finding him for questions what makes things worse he does not follow his own rules on grading my suggestion ishe could be perform better on small groups on special topics but not courses like this we all can feel this course is killing him and us,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,the course videos are quite rushed with some examples not really getting the depth they probably need for instruction external content was needed,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,change the due time for first two assignments and quizes,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,my experience in this course was challenging due to the complexity of the subject compounded by the limitations of an online format while navigating this course i sought guidance and clarification onseveral occasions hoping to solidify my understanding my attempts to confirm my comprehension of the material were denied responses from one of the tas which left me feeling confused anddisappointedfurthermore the responses provided to students seeking clarification on homework questions or topics often boiled down to a nonresponse read the instructions this approach felt insufficient anddiscouragingencouraging a more interactive and supportive environment during office hours and in responses to questions would benefit students striving to grasp this challenging subject matter i hope that futureiterations of this course consider these aspects to provide a more enriching learning experience,"Kennedy, Justin"
17388,for complex algorithms if instructor can explain with more examples or more detailed examples it would be even better,"Kennedy, Justin"
20450,all good,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,perhaps cancel the midterm exam,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,make the calculate and chat independently practice the calculate firstly once we know ts better we can work on the chat function,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,none,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,i wish we had precourse videos instead of reading the textbook because i find the textbook incredibly hard to readunderstand videos are the other hand would be more straightforward,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,no midterm exam,"Rad, Ryan"
20450,this semester we encountered several public holidays which had some impact on the original course schedule it would be even better if we could explore more after the topics of greedy and graph sincethose contents have already been covered in course cs 5008,"Rad, Ryan"
35075,better organization the lectures did not line up with homework assignments or modules which made the course hard to follow additionally while i appreciate the professors use of technology to provide abetter class experience the use of teams made the course more confusing than necessary it was hard to find the course information materials and supplementary materials and because i do not receivenotifications from teams through the web application i often missed announcementsdiscourse additionally it seemed that office hours were more accommodating to students who did not work during theday,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35075,the only thing i found a little challenging was navigating teams gradescope canvas i was always worried i would miss something,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35075,its a lot of material to cover in a short time i have seen these algorithms twice now from undergraduate in a graduate level course i would have expected to see more focus on fewer algorithms andtechniques with deeper analysis of each one this could just be my ignorance of 5000 level or it could be that ne is catering to students in the align program,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35075,please update the syllabus to state the expected hours students need to dedicate to this class i spent on average 30 hours per week for the this class it would helpful to advise students the expectation forthis class is well above the mandatory 1016 hours graduate classesthe textbook introduction to algorithms by thomas cormen charles leiserson ronald rivest and clifford stein was fantastic the other textbook algorithm design by jon kleinberg and eva taros was notuseful in parallel most of the northeastern module videos were not useful and unpractical a suggestion would be to update those module videos for this class,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35075,improve assignments and quizzes the topic in the problem set is always ahead of what we learned in the class as a result students struggle to catch up on assignments dont release all quizzes at the end ofthe semester grade assignments on time not after weeks reply to students messages and dont ignore them publish assignment grading rubrics thats why students know how to write answers toassignment questions,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
31575,make the course more challenging in terms of concepts not homework especially for the ml stuff at the end which could have been related to ir since most of us knew ml to a certain extent,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,make certain homeworks take less time i think i can learn the concepts better if the codeassignment didnt need to run forever,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,stop having assignments that build on each other that group project was entirely unnecessary also dont have assignments that are designed to take a minimum of 12 hours find another way to reinforcethe material that doesnt require hours of processing power,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,it was hard to follow derivationsmath explanations that werent essential to course content it would be great to see more real world demos that would help bring the course into 2023  esp info retrieval inindustry,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,alot of the assignments have you doing work that is not related to the tasks at hand and just makes you spend way more time on it than what is necessary i also feel that the content needs to be refreshedas we are using things made from the early 2000s for example treceval this course is also apart of the ai concentration and i fail to see how this would fall under it,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,i feel that the lectures get dull at times as most of it is just lecturing having more forms of student engagement would help facilitate learning,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,her lectures were not engaging and i found myself drifting a lot also attendance plummeted and the last lecture only had 1075 people,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,way too much was asked of us for the assignments they rarely had much to do with the content,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,some of the homework instructions are confusing and some of the homework is not helpful in topic understanding consider make it more clear  reduce the workload so that it only contain necessary tasksthat helps student understand topics being covered,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,split some of the larger assignments into multiple parts the first few assignments are very difficult and it feels like being thrown into the deep end,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31575,the majority of the grading in this course was based on the practical applications of course material but the instructor mostly taught the theoretical parts,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
15376,appropriately evaluating the tas that are hired for this course most of the tas were to be honest terrible and couldnt answer basic doubts the instructor should actually put in the effort to interview andevaluate the ta applications before appointing them the as tas,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,the one thing that pops into my mind is the fact that some of the assignments could have been better vetted and validated in order to remove easily preventable errors another thing that this course couldbenefit from are more professor office hours the current ones are already well scheduled but i feel like a little more time per week couldnt hurt otherwise i do not really have any other complaints,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,lab 1assignment 1 instructions are slightly outdated so a new video can be created for thatthere are some topics that become that are taught after an assignment has been released and students are working on it alreadyexample command pattern testing the controller with mock modelif these topics could be taught 12 classes earlier then it would help us for assignments more effectively instead of needing to rethink note that is only for a few topics other topics were taught on time,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,the tas selected should have been better often i had to end up solving something myself after a long time because the tas were not helpful enough or well acquainted with the subject,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,while the examples covered during the lectures and in labs showcased the benefits of the design patterns i would have liked to see some examples of evaluatingcomparingdesigning larger scaleapplications eg similar to the image manipulation app that we built throughout assignments 47i think it was the biggest weakness of the course there were limited opportunitiesexperiences of designing and evaluating larger systems,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,the only thing that i can think of is feedback especially when we get 100 on an assignment theres no feedback i felt like the comments from the tas when we lose small points werent enough i would reallyappreciate a review on the overall design in each of the assignments not sure if its feasible though,"Shesh, Amit"
15376,the specifications of the assignments could be clearer labs couldve been more more informative could hire better tas most really did not give feedback in the right direction the things discussed in theclass were coded but never debugged by emulating mistakes that students commonly make,"Shesh, Amit"
40203,provide in class coding examples of the assignment show students how to use tools like networkx and scikitlearn instead of having us teach ourselves at home give more context as to what quizzes will beon teach instead of show youtube clips provide better feedback during office hours instead of vague answers give homework and assignment grades back in a more timely manner allow us to know whatwe will be graded on with rubics if you have a lot going on in your personal life ask for more than one ta so grades can be returned in a timely manner instead of a month later,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,maybe execute some of the stuff we did in assignments in class as well like writing some level of code and executing it  we were provided with templates but i feel like this wouldve helped a whole lot,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,more time being given to contemporary topics like language models and computer vision would have been nice i think it is difficult to balance this with teaching the classic topics as these new techniqueshave full classes dedicated to just nlp and computer vision for example while the classic techniques like adversarial search and csps will likely only be discussed in this ai course a project related to nlpcomputer vision generative ai etc areas would have been a nice addition in my opinion,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,i do not feel the strong relations between the lectures and the assignments the assignments are challenging and requires lots of selflearning the content covered in lectures does not actually help muchin success of assignments,"Veliz, Oscar"
40203,professor oscar speaks too quickly given the amount of information each sentence contains its rather hard for an average student to keep up and more time should be given between each sentence toallow students to process the information also can consider using sentences with easier terms and shorter sentences,"Veliz, Oscar"
17367,could check emailspiazza more often,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,if the office hours could be a bit more friendly to the students on the west coast since the ohs were too early i wasnt really able to join his office hours it was 5am on the west coast,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,less workload and response to email or piazza faster,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,improve ta grading training so as to be consistent with professor improve assignment instruction and fix small bugs,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,discussed above about assignments also on quizzes and exams i understand the reasoning of using random variable names like wer and uyt but it would be helpful to use short nouns or letter combos thatare easily distinguishable from each other several times i lost points on quizzes or exams just because i confused two variables in my head because they sounded very similar to each other,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,extending deadlines to allow students to not overload really quickly,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,professor is the best if something can change that would be last assignment could have been due on november instead of december that way we would have got plenty of time to implement in projectwhat we learned from last assignment even though project was opened beginning os semester what we learned in last two assignment was most implemented in project,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,better management in ta team and oh like having waiting room for professor oh consistent answer from different tas and manageable and sufficient ta office hours,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,have better office hour scheduling considering all of the students from different time zones,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,strengthen the training of teaching assistants the points they give are unreasonable,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,there are some errors in the teaching materials and they could be improved,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,all good,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,maybe simplify the first few assignments a bit as it is most related to styling and put more time to back end node app and api building async etc,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,some of the ta is not that good and responsible,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,i feel it could be better to use less ai autofill that we can better following the code,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,make communication more effective,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,tas need to align their grading standards,"Annunziato, Jose"
17367,more organized office hour,"Annunziato, Jose"
17401, group office hours for students who could use more learning time in addition to inclass,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,i sometimes felt like class sessions were only loosely planned and sometimes it felt like we would get stuck in a topic and it would throw off the original time plan for the course as a whole while i appreciatedthe multimodality of the course especially early on where we did interactive activities in class along with discussion and lecture a little more planning about how long different class elements would takemight speed us along,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,good,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,have additional readings to compliment the classwork,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,schedule assignments better in accordance to current class topics,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,the zybook reading ended up being the least helpful for me  i gravitated towards the cormen and link to mit noteslectures the zybook a very concentrated and useful for review,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,accurately assess all students prior exposure to algorithms in first ever class for the semester,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,i thought the problem sets synthesis and quizzes were great for practicing the skills but i didnt have a lot of time to dedicate to them maybe we dont need to take on a significant workload to sufficientlymaster the material another suggestion could be to reduce the ratio of highly challenging problems,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17401,include more practical coding,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
13666,balance the exam difficulty better exam 1 was brutal later exams were easier,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,the instructor could be a little more clear about the real life applications of some of the more complex algorithms but otherwise he is great,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,more study guide better examsi really appreciate the easier exams but i guess its not for everyonebecause i did worse the second time even though i studied more but just got tested on recursion andthird time i started doubting myself i think i did even worse and more stressedits just weird i was never able to show what i learned from exambut i guess its just me,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,assignment and exam rubrics were harsh there were no partial marking,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,enhance student learning by providing detailed feedback on assignments and exams this could include posting comprehensive solutions and thorough explanations for each assignment and exam coupledwith indepth discussions during class sessions additionally ensure a more strategic selection and fair grading of exam questions to align with the learning objectives,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,sometimes during office hours the instructor could be less condescending in terms of asking students to ask read textbook since its a hard to digest textbook clrs book,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,more coding assignments,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,analysis different algorithms which is not found in the textbook for better understanding also having a lab where we can apply  code the algorithm which we are studying,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,present more enthusiastically,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
13666,it would be helpful to provide us with the lecture note beforeduring a lecture it will make it easier for students to follow in class it is helpful when the projected slide is changed and we still need to readsomething on the previous slide,"Tsekourakis, Iraklis"
15377,while i understand the material of this algorithms course is difficult by nature i feel like i had to use many outside resources and slides from other schools algorithm courses to fully understand and learn thematerial this however was discouraged because we were not allowed to use the internet but i dont think the course is possible without consulting outside resources especially if the resources providedto us are not adequate enough or mostly too complex to even understand the material as a student new to the topicreceiving help from the tas was also a notsofriendly experience because at the beginning of the semester i would receive conflicting information regarding the homeworks i think it would be beneficial tohave the tas prepared and better wellversed on the assignments and topics for office hours,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,nothing that i can think of,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,better explanation,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,not to my knowledge of pretty good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,professor can give lectures more compactly,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,provide more outside materials for practice aside from the homework also working through more problems in class would be helpful sometimes the homework would contain topics that were a little bitconfusing to implement without going over it much,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,go over the complicated concepts that shows up in assignments just in brief or as an overview so we know what to look for,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the office hours hosted by the instructor and most tas were online and i feel more offline office hours would have been better,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think soheil did a great job with the course my only point of contention was with the tas as sometimes it felt as though they did not spend much time reviewing our homework assignments before grading,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,he already did a lot,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,giving out more detail examples step by step explaning,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,some materials are too abstract maybe find a another way to demonstrate theorems,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,listen to students give practice problems beginning of semester,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the slides from his class material can demonstrate more details and example often time i am not able to connect with those information,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,for certain homeworks there were multiple occasions when different tas would give contradictory answers to the doubts this would waste potential time to complete the assignment successfully,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,making teaching and understanding better,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,worked on more recitation or problem solving classes,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,we already took the prerequisite cs5008 spending less time on the topics covered there will make it much betterthe professor forced us to complete this evaluation by quiz its just not right,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,improve pacing in the first half work with tas to be more effective in feedback provided in office hours provide solutions to practice problems in the book either through tas or via the online coursematerials,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,detail specifichelp for interview prep,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,all good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,started using slides from the start of course,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,it would be better if professor can explain the homework in detail in class and provide more practice question for us,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,make grading a little easy,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,screen your tas before those sessions the first ta was great the second ta phoned it in,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,should have focused more on teaching or explaining the topic at first it was fine but when we delved into difficult algorithms the ppt approach was not working that well,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i was not prepared for the first assignment the instructor could share the expectations around the first assignment better by perhaps explaining that the assignment has very little to do with what is taughtin class in terms of the specific material and that the assignment requires many iterations of thinking about each question,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,space better the homeworks to prepare for the midterm and final,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i wish the instructor can provide more detailed notes and more practice problems to solve the assignments,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i feel that the lectures would often get into the granular details of an algorithm and then move to the next then the next etc i think always bouncing back to the broader more abstract ideas and themesthat we should be picking up is essential as is briefly revisiting material from previous lectures for a sort of spaced repetition learning absolutely most of all i would have immensely appreciated if themajority of the time discussing the problemsolving side of divideandconquer dynamic programming and greedy algorithms as opposed to the abstract side mentioned above was spent walking throughyour thought process stepbystep as you figured out how to see the problem through the lens of the given algorithm paradigm it felt instead like it was often treated as somewhat trivial other than a fewtimes where the potential yet wrong dynamic programming approaches to problems were discussed,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,give more time on exams or change to online exam instead of writing code with hand,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,be more concise about introducing new ideas and concepts to the class,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,upload note on slides as some slides are missing,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,he should provides more information and better course rubric,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,start assigning the homeworks earlier and make the first homework a bit lighter latex is kind of scary,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think the lectures could have been a little better organized sometimes we would run out of time going over less core topics and problems,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,more practice,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,grading felt a little unproportionate to mistakes at the beginning of the course the homeworks and lectures seemed completely unrelated but closer to the end they seemed to overlap an appropriateamount to still be challenging while giving you just enough breadcrumbs to peace it together yourself most of the time,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,recitation sessions they were not the same quality as the sessions lead by soheil i think he should teach these sections himself,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,could have included teaching and making us solve leetcode problems which may be more relevant and can help us in preparing for real world dsa interviews,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,probably take some time to show students how to formally make proofs as an example so that students know how to formally prove algorithms without half guessing,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,there is a room for more examples of the concepts explained in the class the assignments were usually very difficult which required a lot of hours and commitment from students,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,homework could have been described properly not much aligned with the material taught in class,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,solve more exercises in class similar to the ones in assignments,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,na,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,maybe more review sessions,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,he is doing great because he exactly knows what he is doing consistency of material are good,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i have no idea at the moment,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,sometimes lectures got disorganized if we were rushing to finish a topic before class ended but this was usually cleared up at the start of the next lecture the homework were incredibly difficult while i didlearn a lot they were impossible for me to do without help from tas,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,scheduling  homeworks were due very close to the finals and midterm,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i dont know,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,provide more reasonable ta office hour this course is a bit too hard but when i need help from ta i could not find them,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,more ta office hours could be assigned,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,more examples of some concepts,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,by order of importanceimpact1 organization communication completeness and timeliness of sharing materials for example participation was graded but never well defined and edge cases were not explained eg dont come to classwhen you have covidleading many students to come anyway which is exlusive policy to immunocompromised people and those with loved ones2 better learning strategy and better defined course objectives structuring the course in a way that obviously meets those learning objectives3 providing adequate support and communication to students give all students more resources especially if they are struggling4 better solutions solutions to in class problems were often rushed and poorly explained providing additional resources and allowing students to study the material in advance both help significantly withthis but you also need to increase your office hours time the tas had lots of office hours but they coudlnt answer the questions and also didnt have enough time to explain the complexity of the problemsthey often struggled to understand the material and would shrug at our problemsi have a lot more constructive feedback but not enough time due to the timed quiz for this my biggest recommendation is to talk to dr lionell who teached 5008 and whos career focus is on effectivelearning techniques,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,better schedule between homework and midterm exam,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the instructor could give more time to study for midterms and finals including working smoothing out the logistics of when assignments are assigned and due the instructor could also upload studymaterialsanswer keys earlier,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,na,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,homework seemed significantly harder than examples given in class,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,the timeline for homework can be planned better,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,dumb down the concepts more,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,i think that student should have more safe environment to experiment and get used with the new content of the class and assignment isnt a good way in my opinion the midterm and the final is also a bittoo long for 90 minutes,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,cover more topics maybe some topics like trees and data structures were not covered also i would like it to be more coding intensive since in real life you have the option to verify your algorithm ratherthan writing on paper where you dont have,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,stronger more clear syllabus and course layout so students are aware of hw release dates and due dates this allows for better semester planning for students that are in other courses the introductionand use of slides was incredibly helpful and should be used throughout the semester more clear communication about upcoming quizzes stronger presence in the classroom to foster a better workingenvironment raising hands quieting loud students etc,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
15377,he could have done a better job reviewing his lectures and homework assignments to make sure there were no mistakes or to make sure that the questions were clear and explicit in what they expectedfrom us he could have done a better job getting the teaching staff on the same page because often we would get completely different answers from different tas so we never knew exactly what wasexpected from us,"Behnezhad, Soheil"
21011,nothing he is perfect,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
21011,expand the sections on deploying and explore those in a lot more depth different options their perks deploying different scales of projects deploying scalable things etc deploying to droplets aws vpsetc,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
21011,align learning with industry use cases and reduce pace early on to accommodate classroom based exercises,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
35058,i definitely struggled with exams but i understand using them as the main way to grade for students like me who arent the fastest test takers it would be helpful to have more practice exams like we didfor exam 1 to use to get more comfortable solving problems quickly and practice concepts were learningid also love some easier practice problems that i can use to work my way up to the more difficult homework assignments sort of like how kids do multiplication tables in grade school to practice some of thebasics before doing some of the harder problems the class in which we went over some basic graph questions is a good example of the type of questions that help me get comfortable working more quicklywith some of the conceptsin general good written feedback was provided for homework in a couple situations it might be nice to expand on that feedback for instance with comments like not a welldefined description it could behelpful to have an example of what would have made it a welldefined description,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,much more optional course work i felt like i would have preferred more practice problems to look at because thats where i tend to learn the most,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,weighting homeworks and not weighing grades on just 5 exams,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,the recordings of his lectures that were 8 years old are not as welldone or easy to follow as when he would record walking through a new power point i wish all the lessons were done in this way the examswere unfairly challenging in my opinion,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,record the lec and do a review on past exams,"Aloupis, Gregory"
35058,can include some pseudo code in the course material and even have some coding assignments apart from that the course is perfect,"Aloupis, Gregory"
37459,longer lectures honestly i could not get enough,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,the submission could be structured more evenly so that the end of semester is not very heavy submission worth more than 60 of total grades were due in the a single week during the course end whichcould have been distributed in a better way,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,have premade material and resources in the beginning of the course,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,provide more informative lectures help us by selecting bettersupporting materials record the lectures,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,better organizing the course too much weightage on few assignment,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,i found the pace of lectures to be too slow to keep me challenged and engaged throughout but too fast to where i would start doing something else and couldnt click back in and catch up i also thing someof the organization of the homework assignments couldve been improved slightly,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,better online resources like recorded videos of classes more informative slidesnotes,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,reduce excessive explanation on theoretical concepts to maintain student engagement,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,lecture notes need to be posted on timeearlier the slides have little information on them and are not very useful when going back to look at them for working on homeworks or the project,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,the only thing that i would think to make this course better would be to use the same 3rd party software as everyone else i found it frustrating in the beginning of the semester to have to learn how to usecampuswire it ended up being much better than piazza which im guessing is why but in the beginning of the semester i was annoyed by it so i guess in all nothing this course was pretty awesome,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,i would appreciate inperson lab time with the tas to practice things or review certain concepts,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,the tas are useless they never answer any of my questions please replace all your tas,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,make sure that students who join little late to the class also get the chance to submit the labs as university allows students to chose the classes by a certain date,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,professor could spend less time explaining things for students answerprofessor could spend less time explain more concrete content instead of something like ethics of ai,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,have a more consistent schedule for assignments having more labs and smaller assignments could help students understand concepts,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,could explore concepts in depth as this is a foundational course,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
37459,better notes,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
40214,record lessons to facilitate the review process,"Sun, Zhifeng"
40214,give more examples for homework,"Sun, Zhifeng"
40214,if the recording could work for every class it will be fantastic,"Sun, Zhifeng"
40214,i wish he provided additional notes as well his current way of teaching is excellent though some notes can make it more effactive,"Sun, Zhifeng"
17364,be more control of the class pace the class is chaoticreduce the unproductive class discussion time or actually give students meaningful topics to discussdeliver meaning class content,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17364,the organization of the course could be improved assignments would be posted before they were covered and sometimes would be due before they were covered additionally several times assignmentinstructions were for past courses with bad dates,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17364,everything is good with course,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17364,hope to learn more knowledge about llm and chatgpt,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17364,nothing yet,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17364,more tas and more office hours,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17364,class more organized,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
17600,instructor did well in everything,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,i think lama did a great job as always i just hoped we learned more new topic in this class over 50 of the course is reviewing things we already laerned in 5008,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,more leetcode style question in assignmentsmore regularly instead of 2 prog sets,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,all good,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,i think the course is great and goes at a manageable pace the assignments are also fair and there are lots of office hours,"Hamandi, Lama"
17371,hire better tas go over homeworks with them so they know what the solution is some tas consistently gave wrong answers,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,a longer exam time and homeworks that feel more connected to the questions asked on exams i found myself floundering through the homeworks as they never seemed to be on topics that were coveredin the course videos or more specifically they were asking for an understanding of the topics i did not get from the course videos to the point that i gave up on actually completing the homeworks myselfand would just use the solutions as a study aid for the exam even doing that however felt fruitless as the exam questions never seemed to connect with the homework in much else than that they werepulled from the same general themei was also always finding myself short on time during exams to the point where i think i was able to answer all of the questions in only 1 out of the 7 exams it is so incredibly frustrating to not be graded on youractual answer to an exam question but on the lack thereof an answer because you didnt have enough time to finish 50 minutes for an online exam that is asking you questions that are supposed to test youon your understanding of the topics instead of asking questions that are variations of homework or extra problem set questions is not realistic two of my first exams were abysmal because i was rushingthrough questions and answered them using a quick method instead of the method asked of me in the question if the 50 minutes is nonnegotiable then maybe cutting the number of questions down to 2 or3 each exam with subproblems might be feasible,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,include more examples for each topic,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,null,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,please rerecord the lectures from when you taught the class in person the audit and visual quality is so poor that i am honestly embarrassed that i paid as much as i did for this course the educationalvalue and overall professionalism of this course is worse than a free udemy or coursera course this course felt like an afterthought rather than something the prof saw as his primary job,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,test difficulty sometimes were challenging and discouragingi genuinely feel sometimes the material provided was not enough to do well in the tests however that kept me going,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,not sure if this is something the instructor could really do but the one thing missing from the course was a sense of community among students of course this was an online course so there are limits towhat can be done in general but it was the one thing i felt was missing from the course,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,good,"Aloupis, Gregory"
40215,give students a better chance to showcase understanding of course work lecturing in a unconcise manner and then using leetcode question as the only homework source doesnt worklecture material and homeworks werent engaging at all this could be the nature of the subject however improvement in this category would certainly help with the problem of student attendance inlecture,"Lee, Hyonho"
40215,i wish the examples shown in class were less messy and drawn more clearly it would also be good if they were uploaded to canvas to make learning easier,"Lee, Hyonho"
40215,there are so many tas no excuse to be grading homework so late when you assign so much of it the quizzes are unfair  the textbook and modules dont align if you ding a student on homework problemswhen you didnt request their code do a certain item or provide an example to work on it is completely unfair,"Lee, Hyonho"
40215,fvnerigjerpogjpoer,"Lee, Hyonho"
40215,the course would be better with a different textbook the current textbook is very dry and many studentstas have expressed their dislike of the textbook instructor could also practice lecturing in acohesive manner maybe include an attendance grade as the lectures had very few people in attendance,"Lee, Hyonho"
40407,add more exercises,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
40407,adding some materials to fill up all of the class time,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
40407,cannot think of any now,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
40407,schedule the class to an earlier time i understand that the instructor has commitments but the current class time is quite late,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
37894,provide more pdf content rather than word based formats i often had to convert ppt slides to pdf to interact with them,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,i think a bit more of livetime interaction with the professor and other students will make this course more interesting,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,nothing,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,maybe create their own material which relate a lot more to the assignments kind of felt a disconnect between assignment and materials given,"Kennedy, Justin"
37894,the course was taught in form of recorded videos by another professor there could have been a proper zoom session by the courses professor for 34 hours a week to go over the topics and explain themin a better way,"Kennedy, Justin"
35265,maybe reduce the number of questions in the problem set assignments which may help students have a better time management during the semester,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35265,better management of the class material and coverage,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
35265,sometimes the assignment question can be asked more concisely,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
20301,forming or joining study groups to collaborate and learn from classmates,"Bhardwaj, Anurag"
20301,increase the readability of the pseudocodes as it is tough to understand and provide a more detailed code walkthrough,"Bhardwaj, Anurag"
20301,not very satisfied with the coursefirst the accent is hard to understandthen the material and the way the teacher teach in class not very comprehensive and enlightening,"Bhardwaj, Anurag"
20301,more organized with lectures some topic in exam did not teach in the lectures,"Bhardwaj, Anurag"
20301,the teaching of the class is a little bit shallow on the algorithms,"Bhardwaj, Anurag"
20301,teach harder spend more time and energy,"Bhardwaj, Anurag"
20302,need to be clear about the algorithms and concepts almost each timealmost every class after the midterm as contents after midterm are difficult she explained one complex algorithm she first went to awrong direction and then tried to come back sometimes she couldnt come back to the right track and already made students really confusedthe instructors ability to explain a complex algo is limited,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,when she draws on ipad she can use another color or the cursor when she explains ie simply saying here and there over the writings sometimes are hard to follow,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,provide better learning materials such as slides,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,teaching pace the pace of teaching is notably fast this speed can be challenging especially for students who need a bit more time to absorb information a slower pace would help in better understandingand following the lectureshomework management there seems to be a need for more organization in terms of homework deadlines and workload consistency and clear communication in this area would be beneficialclass time management there have been instances of class schedules being unexpectedly changed such as the addition of a class due to the professors mistake adherence to the syllabus schedule forclass times would aid in better planning and attendanceteaching assistants involvement it would be helpful if the teaching assistants were more informed about the homework solutions this would enable them to provide better assistance to studentsclarity of notes the legibility of handwritten notes sometimes poses a challenge clearer notes or providing them in a typed format would assist students in taking accurate notes and understanding thematerial more effectively,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,make sure her teaching progress is aligned with the schedule even if some classes are affected by public holidays they should have been handled beforehand,"Mukund, Smruthi"
20302,she is a great professor with that said if she could improve on her organizational skills especially regarding the topics covered in the class that would be helpful,"Mukund, Smruthi"
40408,i think adding more reallife applications to this course material will make this course more interesting,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,provide better distance learning instructional methods,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,thank you so much for your instructions,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,i think the instructor has been already doing very well,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,maybe it is not a good idea to cover the entire book within on semester some parts we did not learn enough,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,balance of mathematics proof and algorithms,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,less homework,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,the assignment is a bit hard could have more hints,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,satisfied with current curriculum,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,i think assignment can be organized better,"Rad, Ryan"
40408,the course is perfect,"Rad, Ryan"
31430,improve the logistics of the course design your own syllabus and course requirements the tas are completely unsure about what is expected the course content taught in class is just slide reading and noin depth understanding of material is provided there is a lot to improve on this course,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31430,better ta hours,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31430,less computing power and less hours to run the code,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31430,the course is perfect assignments challenge you and the classes prepare you for the assignments you get to learn a lot through assignments,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31430,na,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31430,assignments were wellconstructed and complex enough to encourage learning,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
31430,na,"Amor-Tijani, Ghita"
21186,given that this is his first time teaching prof raj is doing great he could revisit his slides to add more information and structure his lecture better,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i believe the material could have been more structured but given that the faculty was new and that this was his first time taking this course i believe he went above and beyond what i would expect a newprofessor would be able to do,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186, more informative slides and notes i personally like video simulations and the working behind algorithms and models  would appreciate more of them as they make the class extremely intuitive,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,sometimes the professor goes a little fast especially when it is related to math concepts but he takes all questions and answers them however could pace down a little sometimes,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,make the content and the lectures bit more detailed and organized,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,discuss the papers he included under reading for the next lecture in class have more handson coding sessions in class and increase the character limit to more than 140 in his quizzes,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,more tas for better doubt clearing when in need,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,in the early part of the semester you can follow the powerpoint and learn a lot but later on its not so easy to follow,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,1 there needs to be a lot more study material readings and notes ppts are not nearly enough they cannot serve as a resource for self study they merely delineate the topics covered in the lecture2 the teaching assisstants seem to change their office hours timings every other day3 have an unofficial prerequisite of basic probability and linear algebra maybe take the first two classes to share to the point high quality resources for these topics and keep a graded assignment to testthese topics since without these it is impossible to grasp anything from mdps and machine learning,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i feel like more informative slides would definitely help more but the professor also didnt have much time to prepare for this course and is definitely an iterative process that will only get better and better,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,explain the concepts in more detail and make the teaching more engaging,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i found myself taking in a lot of technical information like formulas or howtos like how to get loss or something at once and often leaving class forgetting most of it im not sure if this is the fault of theinstructor or me probably mefirstly i think for parts where you writedraw instead of having slides having uploaded notes would be great to look back oversecondly why i think the fault is on me is because im not an ai student and i took this class to try it and i found that i dont really like it so it was easy for me to lose interest in class when so much wasthrown at me which lead to the aforementioned issueregardless though class was enjoyable,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,typed up notes to review after lecture,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i know this was the first year teaching but i would have loved to have more resources and examples on current topics as well as supportive topics that are prerequesets as reminders to bring those behindup to speed,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,provide more informationbackgroundexplanations in the slides for better review of concepts,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,while the lectures were informative i think there are things he should have been better prepared for especially the mathy areas of the course where you would need to pay the most attention,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,have more readings from texxtbooks for the class as just the notes and slides were not enough sometimes,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i really think the set of quiz is so unreasonable if you answer wrong one question you can only get 80 marks it may be reasonable to set 5 questions for a 5 points quiz now you can only get a100otherwise b80 which i think is not fairthe homework tries to include too many things sometimes the pdf is not same as the code description and needs to use campuswire to correct them the details are sometimes not so clear related tohomework i have to revise my homework several times according to the update in campuswire,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i hope the toughness of assignment 2 was a bit less,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,maybe the lectures could be recorded so they can be revisited laterbetter in class resources could be used as the board was not visible properly in the class and sometimes it was difficult to hear him if the mic was not workingtas should be better prepared to answer questions related to the assignment as i found many times they werent able to clear doubts easily,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,improve the expectations of the assignment sometimes i wasnt able to understand what was being asked of me until i spoke to the professor,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,for me personally i felt that during assignment 3 which required heavy usage of pytorch as i had not used the library before and was not aligned with the terminologies it would have been very helpful ifprofessor had taken extra classes or shared some exercises so that i could have tackled the assignment better it does not make sense to teach the fundamentals in the regular class but since i never gotthe opportunity to use these libraries in my undergraduate program or while i was working doing this would have been helpful for me,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,1 using a microphone if its a big class,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,he couldve written some code during the class to demonstrate the concepts,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,the instructor uses a color scheme for the slides that is friendly for color blindness issues however we had plenty of lectures where slides were projected on the chalk board instead of the projectorscreen since the colors of the chalk board and the projector screen is totally opposite the color blind friendly color scheme was not as viewer friendly in terms of readability against the dark backgroundchalkboard,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,incredible instructor and course no changes,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186, added some more content into the slides atleast for later reference sometimes its hard to just look at the material provided for that class to recollect what was discussed during the class the notesprovided is not helpful enough,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,take a few months off prepare the course material and then start teaching again,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,the highlevel discussions on nlp and computer vision were interesting but i could not really follow the technical aspects and didnt feel like i have learnt much,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
21186,i think a recording would really help students reviewing the course material i understand that his lecture slides are supposed to be vague to make it easier to readsee but it does not help a lot when itcomes to reviewing using it homework can be phrased a bit clearer with what direction he wants it to be and there should be some scale that student can use to determine how correct they are with theirsolution without having to involve the ta or the professor and so far that is only available for assignment 1 the last homework can use a bit of an extension too since the final project is around the corner bythat point and its hard to juggle both at the same time,"Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal"
20299,walk through the assignments and explain,"Lee, Hyonho"
20299,they could add more leetcode questions to the classroom,"Lee, Hyonho"
20299,bridge the gap between exam and class material better,"Lee, Hyonho"
20299,post notes,"Lee, Hyonho"
20299,none,"Lee, Hyonho"
20299,firstly it would be good to create easytounderstand lecture files not just copy the clrs for those who dont have experience with cs its tough to understand the original textbooksecondly i would like you to get prepared before teaching we can feel your passion for algorithms but i think the teaching method doesnt fit most of us giving more simple or interesting examples andteaching step by step would be great,"Lee, Hyonho"
20299,perhaps providing some alternative learning resources besides the textbook as the writing in the book was quite complex,"Lee, Hyonho"
20448,dont cover too many things hardly able to remember anything or reduce the complexity of the assignments,"Penarrieta, Cristian"
20312,i think there should be more of a set structure planned in advance of what topics are covered each week and what book chapters correspond to the lecture i found myself often reading 3 chapters listed inthe syllabus as suggested reading and then we did not cover that material in class until a month later when the information was no longer fresh in my mind the topics and chapters listed for a given weekchanged regularly often with 1 days notice if we truly want to learn it is better to know in advance what will be covered in the following week so that we can read and supplement our learning please set thesyllabus before the start of the semester and announce changes to it to everyone preferably with some time for us to prepare and adequately read and learn the material,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,speak louder have clearer quiz and exam questions,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,the assignments and projects of this course are very bad its too few and too vague and too smallscale a largescale projectassignment with steptostep guide will help students better practice whatthey learned in lecturesalso since the lack of practice the quizzes and exams become more difficult and they rely more on remembering the course content instead of understand how they can be used,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,give more feedback on how we performed give study guide before exam the exam is extremely difficult and theres no curve on the score which made us struggled in getting a fair score the exam weightis too high,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,recording lectures would have been helpful,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,upload reading material including power point a few days before each lecture,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,it is better to enrich course content and assign more hands on assignment to let student know how to build an ir system or implement ir algorithms from scratch,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,be more clear in what needs to get done,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,it will be better to use inclass time more efficiently given the exams are very hard it will be helpful to provide clearer guidelines past exam examples before exams,"Amjad, Tehmina"
20312,there could be more coding assignments which play an important role as pratice of concepts learnt from class besides the pace of class is a little bit slow if more concepts or learning stuff could bepresented would be better,"Amjad, Tehmina"
19778,better organization of classroom content and syllabus,"Socha, Katherine"
19778,however algorithm course in cs major is not only about math but also about coding adding more helpful skills from coding side will helps a lot,"Socha, Katherine"
19778,1 please fix the technical issues and organize the canvas so that everything is in the right place2 please provide grades on time3 please use only one textbook for the course as students we spend 60 on an online required book and only use it 23 times the entire semester therefore kindly choose one of the following textbookscormens book dasguptas book or kleinbergtardos book,"Socha, Katherine"
19778,the instructor should focus a lot on stepping through whats being taught in class and covering the syllabus instead of spending a lot of time on trying to nudge the class towards the solution though intheory it sounds good in practice it just results in a lot of class time being wastedproblem sets were extremely difficult and frustrating to solve now i understand that as a masters level student i am expected to learn some concepts on my own and that the professor is not expected toteach every single thing in the syllabus but several problem sets included a lot of content that was not even mentioned in the class at all and that made it extremely difficult to complete themi strongly believe that that the structure of the course is to be blamed here i believe that the professor did everything that she could to help us go through this syllabusthis entire course was structured very poorly and i am beyond disappointed it felt like the course aimed to cover different topics just for the sake of covering it there was no structure to this course at alland it felt like we kept jumping from one concept to another in a haphazard manner the only reason as to why i was able to cope up with this course was because of the fact that i had previously some priorknowledge about some concepts that were taught in this course i could not imagine myself taking this course without the prior knowledge that i had,"Socha, Katherine"
19778,could make the teaching plan more organized,"Socha, Katherine"
19778,sometimes lectures were a little too surface level for the work asked of us in problem sets,"Socha, Katherine"
19778,i feel the course could have been more organized in terms of the material we followed and topics which were covered in the class,"Socha, Katherine"
39709,prefer more activities,"Bayat, Akram"
39709,everything is good,"Bayat, Akram"
39709,the ppt can be more concise and clear,"Bayat, Akram"
39709,exam tends to be a little bit more difficult than expect it would be great if we can have harder questions in homework for challenging ourselves but easier questions in exam for testing fundamentalknowledges,"Bayat, Akram"
17387,nothing,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,there were occasional bugs in the hw code instructions but this is a minor issue,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,check the code in the assignment make sure everything is correct,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,the workload for this class is pretty high for this course for students are taking two classes andor looking for internship its stresful to finish the assignments on time it would be nice if the instructors canadjust the workload to a more reasonable amount or provides more guidanceexplanation for the homework,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,exams are too tricky i found it hard to understand the basis of the code for some questions because things were named too similarly,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,the lectures move more slowly,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,have tas more responsible,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387, have the kanbas assignment connect together better where at the end of the long process we have something working thats presentable and functioning,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,no improvements needed,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,tas need to be trained some tas are irresponsible they didnt know about the assignment and went to the office hour or grade the students assignment,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,make it more logic from the overall standviewin our course the emphasis is often on instant responses rather than systematic learning moving from messy code to normalized code however ive found that this approach leaves a gap inunderstanding the overall architecturemoreover the challenging nature of messy code brings overwhelming workload pressure weekly i invest excessive time in dealing with messy codeim looking for a more efficient and concise approach thanks,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,some assignment took too much time,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,more time to finish the lab,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,the professor switched the course midway through from involved indepth challengebased material to copypaste fest as a result of workload complaints this drastically reduced the quality of thecourse and made homework assignments the equivalent of following a medium article would have been better standing by the standard set by earlier assignments and forcing people to actually coderather than copy paste,"Annunziato, Jose"
17387,lessen the workload,"Annunziato, Jose"
31750,the lectures were sometimes difficult to follow because of their length and complexity of the topics  i think that sometimes it was difficult to come away with the main ideas because of all the informationprovided in the slides,"Smith, David"
31750,nothing much 1,"Smith, David"
31750,lectures are way to dry people stopped showing up to class because we just couldnt follow the lectures i think the class just covers way to much information this could be split up into two classes also ithink the few lectures where we had a small in class activity were fine ie that one time we had to compress a file so professor needs to have something like that almost every lecture but that goes back tothe class needing to cover less information lastly the homeworks were very helpful in learning the content but there were only 4 of them so please add more maybe like 68 slightly smaller homeworksthat take a week to do overall the problem in my opinion lies more with the class than the professor but i hope the professor can adjust in the future,"Smith, David"
31750,the lectures given in class were way way way too dense to have any chance of being able to store all of the information or even take notes on it there was also so much lecture material that i felt that therewas no real benefit of going to class as there was no way i was going to remember to solve this i think the content in this course needs to be greatly cut down maybe cover half to two thirds of the contentthis semester each class just seemed like a fire hose of information and after 15 minutes i was usually unable to continue paying attention i think this sentiment was felt by most other students given thesevere lack of attendance in classi think there was also just such a huge lack of homework in the class the fact that we had only four homeworks one midterm and a final project for a 4000 level class is just crazy to me the homeworkswere all really good really interesting and were a good level of challenging i think we could have done with maybe 6 7 or even 8 homeworks over the semester these assignments is where i learned themost and also had the most fun in the classthe midterm was good i just feel like given the such huge amount of information covered in the course there was no real good way to study and the lack of reinforcement of knowledge outside of classmade it even more difficulti think there could have been a lot more room for interactivity during class i think that would have greatly improved attendance as well as made the class a lot less boringi also feel that there is no reason to have the class so theory based and having more homeworks would help greatly with this i think what makes northeastern cs so good is that it is so application based andthere was absolutely none of this during the course,"Smith, David"
31750,the project was very confusing to understand what i mean by that is we had very little idea about what is actually expected of us and the scope that the instructor is looking for this was exacerbated bythe fact that we didnt have any sample project to compare to so we could understand the extent to which we should evaluate our results to match the expectations of the course,"Smith, David"
31750,the instructor could have taught the concepts more clearly as it was like he,"Smith, David"
35155,na,"Dym, Brianna"
35155,course is already great,"Dym, Brianna"
35155,add an additional 12 assignments to explore more about the technologies,"Dym, Brianna"
35155,nothing,"Dym, Brianna"
35155,more clear questions in the assignemnt its better if they tell hoe they are grading,"Dym, Brianna"
35155,bring more challenging assignments,"Dym, Brianna"
35155,could have given more collaborative activities like discussion quizzes that may be done in groups,"Dym, Brianna"
10855,provide a little clearer instructions about some assignments eg in assignment about sparse matrix i have all junits passed but my marks were cut based on fact that i used get for all elements whilepremul and postmul may be you can include requirements like complete these tasks in on complexity etc,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,i felt like the assignments could have been more fun and interesting and engaging to students however the scope and the size of the assignments made it so we couldnt explore each aspect of theassignment thoroughly instead of adding 23 image manipulations we had to put 6 which made us focus on the logic of manipulating the image rather than the importance of design of our application,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,na,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,this course has been extremely satisfactory to me with the kind of course contents and the level of thought put in behind each lab and assignment,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,nothing i can think about he is best at what he does,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,nil,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,1 one of the complaints i have from this course is regarding the assignment autograder it is far too aggressive to the point where it sometimes even flags the syntax used by the professor in class aswrong eg underscore naming convention for private helper methods i get the point of enforcing style constraints to improve code quality i am not against that however i believe the currentconfiguration needs to be dialled down a notchjustification incorrect deductions by the java style checker take time to fix in every assignment it is time a student could better spend thinking about other code optimisationsin fact in many assignments the starter code given by the professor itself were flagged by the style checker eg too long javadoc description for a class2 ensure that there is lab per design pattern taught in class if the course calendar does not permit having labs for the last two or three design patterns there can be ungraded labs for them this wouldensure students get a chance to reinforce the concepts taught in class even if said concepts are taught at the end3 make the grading rubric more flexibleless aggressive excessive penalisation demotivates students from trying out new ideas the goal of grading should be to coursecorrect a studentsapproachcoding practices not discourage them from deviating from known methods i believe the current grading scheme rewards sticking to known methods and discourages exploration,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,i know that the design revolves around oop concepts and java makes the most advantage of it i really think that some versatility should have been offered for the choice of programming language to beused furthermore the assignments being related to only image manipulations were not that exciting maybe something different could have peaked my interest,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,lesser students so that there is more time during office hours and not as much rush or host more office hours if possible typical office hours wait time for the professor is extremely long ranging from 13hours,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,make the evaluation criteria clear to students beforehand before the evaluation and codewalks,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,maybe give more time for us to complete our assignments or labs,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,nothing it was up to the mark,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,instructor can put a note or ask students to go through some basic concepts of java before starting the assignments this is not a very strong suggestion but might help some individuals,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,i think the course structure is fine but a few of the concepts are rushed toward the end so maybe reduce some portion of it,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,incredible instructor and course no changes,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,na no complaints,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,the ta evaluation is extremely variable some tas are very generous and others arent this makes it extremely unfair,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,to enhance the overall course experience it might be beneficial for the instructor to consider slightly reducing the coursework load managing the current workload can be challenging and a moderateadjustment could contribute to a more balanced and manageable learning environment for students,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,provide some clearer instructions on assignments,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,as the name of the course is programming design paradigm and there are a lot of other programming languages apart from java there should be some focus towards how the designing remains thesamediffers when you are coding in any other language there should be some generic content across languages added to the course,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,there could have been more complex examples taken during the lecture so that it is better to understand the nuances of the concept which basic and simple examples dont highlight,"Shesh, Amit"
10855,the course is inherently selfsufficient and has been meticulously designed by the instructor requiring no additional modifications,"Shesh, Amit"
10855, probably tone down the intensity of the business logic of the code in assignments as i felt the time could have been better spent well on optimising the design improving it or even solving an even morecomplex design during office hours we have noticed that a ta is helping out only a single student for an hour or more and even 3 hours in few instances this could probably be avoided and set a timer of 15mins for eachstudent and could be asked to rejoin the queuethis could help bring down the unreasonably long waiting times in the office hours even though there are 4 tas available often,"Shesh, Amit"
11550,provide more organized assignments lectures demanded a lot of time on top of already demanding class work,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,upload lecture videos more promptly,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,the instructor should have given more time for the project,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,nothing much,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,have a better office hour system for students many students facing waiting in line for almost a hour to get into the zoom meeting and i felt like theres not a very clear schedule like rubrics for tas to followif almost 80 students are facing the deployment problem and each of them goes to ask for help from ta it would cause lot of people waiting and not getting a better learning experience in this case a tacan make an announcement in piazza to answer deployment problem or to show tutorial for all students this is just an example thank you very much i learned a lot from this course and wish this course tobe better an better for infuture students,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,reduce a little bit of course load,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,its hard to follow an instructor in class and do hw and still end up spending extra time rewatching the instructors video several times but the nice thing about recording is that you can see it until you learnit but its time consuming,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,pretty much nothing but can be given us something realtime projects and tasks,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,assignments can be a little more challenging without providing the entire starter code,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,more challenging assignments avoid giving all the code,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,the management of the ta group is messy,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,make the assignments less redundant,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,everything is already perfect,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,he is a very good professor,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,lessen the amount of assignments exams quizzes,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,hire better tas,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,na,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,his online material was out of date,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,setup the khoury office hours app for this course the tas just have their zoom links and there is no transparency if the ta is available or not during their office hours many a times we would be just stuck inthe waiting room unaware if the ta is busy with a student or unavailable altogether,"Annunziato, Jose"
11550,cover best practicesvariable names on midterm were extremely difficult to keep straight ie asd dsa qwe ewq etc in the same question more thought was put into keeping vars straight rather than webdev concepts,"Annunziato, Jose"
40252,maybe reduce the number of questions in the problem set assignments which may help students have a better time management during the semester,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
40252,better management of the class material and coverage,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
40252,sometimes the assignment question can be asked more concisely,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
37421,providing more opportunities to practice working with react components and testing throughout the assignments can help to solidify what we learned,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,more in class activates current ones are amazing,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,make inclass activities a little more interactive this improved as the course went on,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,the instructor could further enhance the course by incorporating more interactive elements such as quizzes and practical exercises during the online sessions this would help reinforce learning and keepstudents more engaged additionally offering optional supplementary sessions on complex topics could provide additional support for those who may need more time to grasp the material lastly increasingthe frequency of feedback on assignments might also help students better understand their progress and areas for improvement throughout the course,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,please explain the concepts better only one slide and one example cannot help to do the assignments,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,class recording,"Mitra, Joydeep"
37421,the assignment specifications dont clearly delineate the description of a feature,"Mitra, Joydeep"
11382,align it with the latest developments and focus on the practical aspect,"Smith, David"
11382,the machine learning part feels overwhelming to grasp at times so professor could probably go in some details,"Smith, David"
11382,the course could be more interactive if the instructor didnt just go over the slides skipping the main ideas of the difficult probability formulas instead the instructor could point to the formula call its nameand then ask students to implement it in the midterm exam when the derivation of the formulas is skipped it becomes impossible to understand them completely use them efficiently and moreoverremember them additionally the pace of the lecture is too fast making it very hard to follow the instructor the attendance of the class dropped from 50 to 8 people with students showing up only for themidterm this is because reading the book is way more helpful than attending the lecturesthe assignment grading is another negative experience there is no rubric and no helpful feedback on graded assignments when you ask tas who havent taken this course before for help they do theirbest however they grade according to the key which is different from what they advised students to do,"Smith, David"
11382,please make lectures less dry,"Smith, David"
35156,more examples do the calculations on the board for more complex problems the last midterm was too long for the time that was given it could be made slightly shorter,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,midterm 2 was a bit too difficult although the grades were curved the wait until i got my results was brutal,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,the assignments could be split and be provided on weekly basis as towards the end the assignment weightage increased,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,keep exam simple as assignment,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,design the assignments and exams with tas more carefully since they are too hard for most students and contain many bugs which waste our time to figure them out,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,make clearer slides some slides are just bogged down by math and extra informationlet the students apply what we learned there was barely any coding in this course to see the fruits of our ai education homework assignments were centered around theory with written solutions andfilling out outcomes of methodsalgorithms which is still helpful but it only goes so far for our brains and our resume if we dont learn how to do anything practical in ai then our knowledge will just pass overour heads,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,maybe reduce workload,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,reduce the syllabus to make it less overwhelming,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,more support materials,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,the new hws had some errors and that increases the time required to do them accounting for that with extended deadlines might be helpfulalso need a lot more office hours,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,go over more concrete examples showing the specific math steps,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,need to better grasp the key idea in lecture need more examples to explain the concepts,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,reduce reinforcement learning material and and more on supervised learning,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,develop more online office hour like zoom to help more students to slove their problems,"Amato, Christopher"
35156,pace the course betterthe first exam covered very little and was made very simple which left us a ton of material to cover for the second exam on top of multiple long homework assignment on top of a large project the end ofthe semester was incredibly stressful and felt a little like we were being punished for the professor not pacing the class correctly,"Amato, Christopher"
40250,not in relation to professor but if an additional web dev class was offered to have more time to work with all the different tools and frameworks,"Bogden, Philip"
40250,sometimes homework due dates were a little confusing but otherwise no notes,"Bogden, Philip"
40250,nothing,"Bogden, Philip"
40250,id appreciate slightly more time spent in class discussing theoretical concepts we spent a lot of time in active programming work which i really enjoyed but i think a few more minutes of each class couldhave been focused on theory structure or best practices since often our assignments were to finish the inclass activities it would have been okay to have the inclass activities get slightly less time,"Bogden, Philip"
40250,maybe some additional readings information tutorials about different frameworks or beginning each class with a here is the big idea for today and what i want you to leave todays class having learnedhe does do this but i think maybe needs to be a bit clearer in what will be covered and how it fits into the big picture,"Bogden, Philip"
11209,provide better instructions for content beyond search and markov chains examples in class sometime became confusing because of the convoluted examples used homeworks were extremelyinconsistent often times context of problems were confusing where the professor admit that the context is confusing there were many instances where the question was wrong or misleading as wellgrading also became an issue where often times tas were proven to be incorrect i often wonder whether the tas graded correctly because some of the questions the tas or professor refuse to give thesolution and i question how grading was performed overall i just got tired of bad homework problems bad ta gradings trying to understand confusing material that he teaches but is completely clear froma previous professor i have taken at neu i have had many excellent professors at neu who taught better and this professor failed to deliver,"Amato, Christopher"
11209,professor amatos lectures are dry and seem to be built around a level of student interaction that he doesnt get homework often felt like it was coming out late or based on material we hadnt gotten toyet the pace of the class felt very confused,"Amato, Christopher"
11209,tas did not seem knowledgable in subjectmore oh times with professor that worked better in the weekly schedule ie not the day ps were duemore examples in classhave ps ready earlier,"Amato, Christopher"
11209,the professor should explain the concepts and at least implement the algorithms in the class instead of assuming that students will understand everything just from ppt,"Amato, Christopher"
11209,the cs188 assignments both problem sets and programming assignments need to be replaced the slides as well,"Amato, Christopher"
11209,instructor could grade performance more fairly and provide homework solution so students do not repeat same mistakes in exam,"Amato, Christopher"
11209,adding more basic concepts in regard to machine learning and explaining concepts clearly,"Amato, Christopher"
11209,get more tas since there are only 4 tas and they dont respond on piazza as well as dont know the concepts when visiting office hours could provide solutions of the problem sets,"Amato, Christopher"
40251,better organization the lectures did not line up with homework assignments or modules which made the course hard to follow additionally while i appreciate the professors use of technology to provide abetter class experience the use of teams made the course more confusing than necessary it was hard to find the course information materials and supplementary materials and because i do not receivenotifications from teams through the web application i often missed announcementsdiscourse additionally it seemed that office hours were more accommodating to students who did not work during theday,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
40251,the only thing i found a little challenging was navigating teams gradescope canvas i was always worried i would miss something,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
40251,its a lot of material to cover in a short time i have seen these algorithms twice now from undergraduate in a graduate level course i would have expected to see more focus on fewer algorithms andtechniques with deeper analysis of each one this could just be my ignorance of 5000 level or it could be that ne is catering to students in the align program,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
40251,please update the syllabus to state the expected hours students need to dedicate to this class i spent on average 30 hours per week for the this class it would helpful to advise students the expectation forthis class is well above the mandatory 1016 hours graduate classesthe textbook introduction to algorithms by thomas cormen charles leiserson ronald rivest and clifford stein was fantastic the other textbook algorithm design by jon kleinberg and eva taros was notuseful in parallel most of the northeastern module videos were not useful and unpractical a suggestion would be to update those module videos for this class,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
40251,improve assignments and quizzes the topic in the problem set is always ahead of what we learned in the class as a result students struggle to catch up on assignments dont release all quizzes at the end ofthe semester grade assignments on time not after weeks reply to students messages and dont ignore them publish assignment grading rubrics thats why students know how to write answers toassignment questions,"Mwaura, Jonathan"
11744,assignments could have been paced better otherwise the course is highly recommended,"Smith, David"
11744,he could be more transparent about the deadlines and what each homework is going to be about he should adapt the course to our current time not have slides based on a 2010 book i think we shouldvehad more practical assignments and one which included scraping,"Smith, David"
11744,pace the course better,"Smith, David"
39756,update homework rubric on time,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
39756,make a clearer syllabus in homework session,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
39756,na,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
39756,nothing prof john is the best ,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
39756,i have no idea i think current is good maybe edit the assignment ahead of time,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
39756,maybe it would be better to put things we mentioned in classes in the canvas modules every week we have plenty of links to the interesting resources published on slack but sometimes i get lost in themessage stream and forget to read them all,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
39756,its interesting to learn about pdp on a software hardware platform instead of just the web this provides more opportunities for students to apply for jobs in line with market needs,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
39756,i think we spent a solid amount of time learning a programming language instead of the different programming paradigms this is something that could be improved,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
39756,professor is constantly changing honestly i enjoy this uncertainty in classroom as well except for the implicitness of assignments requirements i hope i can learn various aspects through changes in classwhile knowing the exact expectation of assignments so i can focus on what should i do,"Guerra Gomez, John Alexis"
15054,if both canvas and handins are being used then i want the percentage weightage or points for each assignment to be mentioned in canvas this would be more helpful for new students who might havemissed out on handins,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,i would say nothing just should have made video lectures public from the start  maybe only that,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,not sure maybe assignment 3 could have been easier,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,i am happy with the syllabus and the way the course was presented,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,na,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,really the only thing would be to shore up the corner cases of the assignments that could go one way or another,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,having a clearer understanding of the expectations for the selfevaluation would have allowed for better preparation and integration of these elements into the project i believe this is where i missed out onmarks which im not pleased about a better grasp of these expectations could have helped me achieve a higher score,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,nothing more,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,a little more feedback from the professor on our assignments instead of just from the tas would be helpful,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,i have 0 complaints it was great,"Shesh, Amit"
15054, i could not find flaw in his methodology or his course content but i do wish the classes were a bit spread out instead of having a fairly long class time,"Shesh, Amit"
15054,have extra sessions for student with no programmingwork experience apart from lecture hours office hours and labs so people like us would feel a little less intimidated concept in class were explainedwell but for people that take time to understand or grasp a concept the lectures could seem a little fast paced,"Shesh, Amit"
40243,na,"Dym, Brianna"
40243,course is already great,"Dym, Brianna"
40243,add an additional 12 assignments to explore more about the technologies,"Dym, Brianna"
40243,nothing,"Dym, Brianna"
40243,more clear questions in the assignemnt its better if they tell hoe they are grading,"Dym, Brianna"
40243,bring more challenging assignments,"Dym, Brianna"
40243,could have given more collaborative activities like discussion quizzes that may be done in groups,"Dym, Brianna"
