35058,i cannot say enough good things about prof aloupis the way he breaks down difficult concepts is fantastic his library of online resources filled with his previous lectures and slides is infinitely helpful  ivewatched each lecture multiple times and i think i will continue to reference them throughout my careerhe explains algorithms in a very visual way in the past ive struggled with grasping some of the harder concepts because the way theyve been explained in books or class has been really flat  i haventbeen able to really see how some solutions or even data structures work but prof aloupis takes the time to make them really accessible his diagrams are brilliant he color codes everything which makesthings so much clearer  i can actually see how things fit together he doesnt speed through steps he concentrates on the theory and the concepts and really explains the why and how behind everythingwhich means we actually learn and understand the concepts and can use them later rather than just memorizing them he goes over actual problems so we can see how theories work in multiple situationsprof aloupis is approachable and asks questions of students during class to encourage participation its clear there is no judgment and there are no dumb questionsi really appreciated him taking the time to survey students early in the semester and then reach out to us to have oneonones its so hard to create a sense of community in online classes and this was agreat way to make connectionsi very much appreciate that he offers makeup lectures whenever theres canceled class due to holidays i feel this class has excellent valueits obvious that prof aloupis values student input and is constantly striving to improve,"Aloupis, Gregory"

17600,reading and quizzes were very help in learning material and coming into class prepared a strength of this is the lecture set up lectures styles is is very helpful in correcting quizzes and learning moreinformation related to it,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,lama is my favorite professor so far and i have no complaints whatsover about her  she is always organized communicative friendly and understandablehowever i dont exactly see the point of having 5008 and 5800 at the same time  there is so much overlap of knowledge between the two i think we should cover more content on 5800 that was not taughtin 5008 or more leetcode exercise etc to make this course more useful to be fair this course was not nearly as challenging and rewarding as 5008 because so much of 5800 is already covered in 5008,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,fair and kind to every student,"Hamandi, Lama"
17600,the absolute best professor at the sf campus she is so dedicated to the students learning it is amazing to seegets students to participate in class gives good amount of assignments to learn but also not too much that it overwhelms students,"Hamandi, Lama"

17371,i actually found the online lectures very interesting and engaging,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,the professor created optional homework assignments but then graded them much harsher than the tests were graded i got points off for both being too explicit in my proofs and not being explicit enough it felt like he instructed his graders to assess whether we answered the homework in the same way he did proofs in class rather than assess how we we answered the question itself i have always beentaught that there is no one right way to prove something  proofs are a form of communication like essay writing and should be assessed based on how well the point is communicated since homework wasso poorly graded and did not contribute to my actual grade i stopped doing them altogether half way through the course,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,good and easy to follow material,"Aloupis, Gregory"
17371,course taught valuable problem solving skills in addition to the obvious teaching of algorithmic approaches and optimizations also this is more a personal opinion than a general strength of the course but ithought the course was very interestinginstructor explained subject matter clearly provided thorough answers to questions both in office hours and via email responded promptly to emails fostered student enthusiasm for the course material,"Aloupis, Gregory"
